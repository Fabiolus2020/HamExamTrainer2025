explanation,"A repeater listens on one frequency and retransmits on another, usually from a high location, so low-power mobile and handheld stations can reach much farther. Memory Trick: Picture a &quot;radio on a hill&quot; that hears you and shouts your signal farther."
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-002
,
question,What is frequency coordination on VHF and UHF bands?
optionA,A part of the planning prior to a contest
optionB,A process which seeks to carefully recommend frequencies to minimize interference with neighbouring repeaters
optionC,A band plan detailing modes and frequency segments within a band
optionD,The selection of simplex frequencies used by individual operators
correctOption,B
explanation,Frequency coordination is the organized process where a recognized body recommends repeater input/output pairs so systems do not interfere with each other. Memory Trick: Think of &quot;air-traffic control for repeaters&quot; – making sure they don&apos;t collide.
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-003
,
question,What is the purpose of a repeater time-out timer?
optionA,It logs repeater transmit time to predict when a repeater will fail
optionB,It tells how long someone has been using a repeater
optionC,It interrupts lengthy transmissions
optionD,It hands over control to each user in turns
correctOption,C
explanation,"The time-out timer shuts the repeater transmitter off after a maximum transmission length to protect it from overheating and to prevent a stuck microphone from tying it up. Memory Trick: &quot;Timer = time limit&quot; – too long, and the machine cuts you off."
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-004
,
question,What is a CTCSS tone?
optionA,A tone used by repeaters to mark the end of a transmission
optionB,A signal used for telemetry by amateur radio satellites
optionC,A signal used for radio control of model craft
optionD,A sub-audible tone that activates a receiver audio output when present
correctOption,D
explanation,"CTCSS adds a low-frequency &quot;sub-audible&quot; tone to the signal. Only receivers set for that tone will open their squelch, reducing unwanted noise and interference. Memory Trick: CTCSS = &quot;Code Tone to Control Squelch.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-005
,
question,How do you call another station on a repeater if you know the station&apos;s call sign?
optionA,"Say the station&apos;s call sign, then identify your own station"
optionB,"Say &quot;break, break,&quot; then say the station&apos;s call sign"
optionC,"Say &quot;CQ&quot; three times, then say the station&apos;s call sign"
optionD,"Wait for the station to call &quot;CQ,&quot; then answer it"
correctOption,A
explanation,"You make a directed call on the repeater by saying the other station&apos;s call sign once, followed by your own. Memory Trick: &quot;VA3XYZ, this is VE3ABC&quot; is the model – called station, then you."
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-006
,
question,Why should you pause before and between transmissions when using a repeater?
optionA,To give the repeater time to respond
optionB,To listen for anyone else wanting to use the repeater
optionC,To check the SWR of the repeater
optionD,To reach for pencil and paper for third-party communications
correctOption,B
explanation,"A brief pause allows other stations – especially those with emergency traffic – to break in, and lets the repeater&apos;s time-out timer reset. Memory Trick: &quot;Pause for others&quot; – a short gap keeps the channel shared and safe."
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-007
,
question,Why should you keep transmissions short when using a repeater?
optionA,To reduce the bandwidth used by the repeater
optionB,To avoid exceeding the repeater&apos;s memory storage
optionC,A long transmission may prevent someone with an emergency from using the repeater
optionD,To keep long-distance charges down
correctOption,C
explanation,"Long transmissions can overheat the repeater and block others, including someone with urgent traffic, from getting in. Memory Trick: &quot;Short overs, long life&quot; – short transmissions help everyone."
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-008
,
question,What is the proper way to join a conversation on a repeater?
optionA,Wait for the end of a transmission and start calling the desired party
optionB,"Shout &quot;break, break!&quot; to show that you&apos;re eager to join the conversation"
optionC,Increase power to override whoever is talking
optionD,Say your call sign during a break between transmissions
correctOption,D
explanation,The polite method is simply to drop in your call sign during a pause; the other stations can then invite you in. Memory Trick: &quot;Callsign in the gap&quot; – no shouting or doubling needed.
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-009
,
question,What is the accepted way to ask someone about their location when using a repeater?
optionA,Where are you?
optionB,What is your 10-20?
optionC,Locations are not normally broadcast over the radio
optionD,What is your 10-85?
correctOption,A
explanation,Amateur radio practice is to use plain language such as &quot;Where are you?&quot; rather than CB-style &quot;10-codes.&quot; Memory Trick: &quot;Plain English beats 10-codes&quot; on ham bands.
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-010
,
question,FM repeater operation on the 2-metre band uses one frequency for transmission and one for reception. What is the standard difference between the transmit and receive frequencies (known as &quot;offset&quot;)?
optionA,400 kHz
optionB,600 kHz
optionC,800 kHz
optionD,1000 kHz
correctOption,B
explanation,"On 2&nbsp;metres, the standard repeater offset is 600&nbsp;kHz (0.6&nbsp;MHz), either plus or minus depending on the local band plan. Memory Trick: &quot;Two metres, point-six shift&quot; – 600&nbsp;kHz is the number to remember."
BankQuestionID,B-002-001-011
,
question,"To make your call sign better understood when using voice transmissions, what should you do?"
optionA,Talk louder and faster
optionB,Turn up your microphone gain
optionC,Use International Telecommunication Union phonetic alphabet code words to spell letters in your call sign
optionD,Use any words which start with the same letters as your call sign for each letter of your call
correctOption,C
explanation,"Using the official ITU phonetic alphabet (&quot;Victor Echo Three Alfa Bravo Charlie&quot;) makes each letter clear, especially under weak or noisy conditions. Memory Trick: Think &quot;ITU phonetics = universal spelling&quot; so everyone understands."
BankQuestionID,B-002-002-001
,
question,What can you use as an aid for correct station identification when using voice?
optionA,Q codes
optionB,Unique words of your choice
optionC,A speech compressor
optionD,The International Telecommunication Union phonetic alphabet
correctOption,D
explanation,"The ITU phonetic alphabet is the standard tool for clear voice identification; Q-codes are for CW and data, not spelling call signs. Memory Trick: &quot;When in doubt, spell it out&quot; – with the ITU list."
BankQuestionID,B-002-002-002

question,"In the International Telecommunication Union phonetic alphabet, what is the code word for the letter I?"
optionA,Item
optionB,India
optionC,Iran
optionD,Italy
correctOption,B
explanation,"India is correct because it is the official ITU phonetic for the letter I. Standard phonetics avoid confusion when accents, noise or fading make letters sound similar. Memory Trick: Picture the sequence &quot;Hotel India Juliet&quot; marching across the band."

question,"In the International Telecommunication Union phonetic alphabet, what is the code word for the letter L?"
optionA,London
optionB,Luxembourg
optionC,Lima
optionD,Love
correctOption,C
explanation,"Lima is correct because it is the standard ITU phonetic word for L. Non-standard words like &quot;Love&quot; or &quot;London&quot; may be misunderstood, especially internationally. Memory Trick: Hear &quot;Kilo Lima Mike&quot; when you think of K–L–M."

question,"In the International Telecommunication Union phonetic alphabet, what is the code word for the letter P?"
optionA,Portugal
optionB,Paris
optionC,Peter
optionD,Papa
correctOption,D
explanation,"Papa is correct because it is the official ITU phonetic for P. Using &quot;Papa&quot; instead of names or places keeps things predictable for all operators worldwide. Memory Trick: Imagine &quot;Papa Quebec Romeo&quot; – P, Q, R in phonetics."

,
question,"In the International Telecommunication Union phonetic alphabet, what is the code word for the letter R?"
optionA,Romeo
optionB,Roger
optionC,Radio
optionD,Romania
correctOption,A
explanation,"Romeo is correct because it is the standard ITU phonetic word assigned to R. &quot;Roger&quot; is a procedural word meaning &quot;received&quot;, not the phonetic for R. Memory Trick: Think &quot;Romeo Sierra&quot; – R and S dancing together on sideband."
BankQuestionID,B-002-002-011
,
question,What is the correct way to call &quot;CQ&quot; when using voice?
optionA,"Say &quot;CQ&quot; at least ten times, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; followed by your call sign spoken once"
optionB,"Say &quot;CQ&quot; three times, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; followed by your call sign spoken three times"
optionC,"Say &quot;CQ&quot; once, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; followed by your call sign spoken three times"
optionD,"Say &quot;CQ&quot; at least five times, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; followed by your call sign spoken once"
correctOption,B
explanation,"Say &quot;CQ&quot; three times, then &quot;this is&quot;, then your call sign three times is the classic and clear pattern for a general call. It is long enough to be noticed but not overly repetitive. Memory Trick: 3–3 pattern: &quot;CQ&quot; 3 times, your call 3 times."
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-001
,
question,How should you answer a voice CQ call?
optionA,"Say the other station&apos;s call sign at least three times, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; and your call sign at least five times"
optionB,"Say your call sign twice, followed by &quot;calling,&quot; then the other station&apos;s call sign"
optionC,"Say the other station&apos;s call sign once, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; then your call sign"
optionD,"Say the other station&apos;s call sign at least five times, followed by &quot;this is,&quot; then your call sign twice"
correctOption,C
explanation,"You answer by saying the calling station&apos;s call sign once, then &quot;this is&quot;, then your call sign. That immediately tells them the call is for them and who is answering. Memory Trick: &quot;You then me&quot; – their call, then yours."
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-002
,
question,What is simplex operation?
optionA,Transmitting and receiving over a wide area
optionB,Transmitting on one frequency and receiving on another
optionC,Transmitting one-way communications
optionD,Transmitting and receiving on the same frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"Simplex operation means both stations transmit and receive on the same frequency, with no repeater involved. Duplex operation (like most repeater use) uses different input and output frequencies. Memory Trick: Simplex = &quot;simple, single frequency&quot; at both ends."
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-003
,
question,When should you consider using simplex operation instead of a repeater?
optionA,When signals are reliable between communicating parties without using a repeater
optionB,When the most reliable communications are needed
optionC,When an emergency telephone call is needed
optionD,When you are travelling and need some local information
correctOption,A
explanation,"If you can hear each other well directly, you should switch to simplex and free up the repeater for other users or emergencies. Memory Trick: &quot;If we hear each other fine, leave the machine behind.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-004
,
question,Why should local communications use VHF and UHF frequencies instead of HF frequencies?
optionA,Because signals are stronger on VHF and UHF frequencies
optionB,To minimize clutter on HF bands more appropriate for long-distance communication
optionC,Because greater output power is permitted on VHF and UHF
optionD,Because HF transmissions are not propagated locally
correctOption,B
explanation,"HF bands are especially valuable for long-distance (DX) and regional work. Using VHF/UHF for local chat keeps HF from being clogged with short-range contacts. Memory Trick: &quot;Local = VHF/UHF, DX = HF.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-005
,
question,Why should you be careful in choosing a simplex frequency when operating VHF or UHF?
optionA,Implanted medical devices share the same spectrum
optionB,Some frequencies are designated for narrow band FM and others for wideband FM
optionC,To avoid inadvertently choosing a frequency that is the input to a local repeater
optionD,Some frequencies cannot accommodate simplex operation
correctOption,C
explanation,Many repeater systems use specific input frequencies. Operating simplex on one of those can unintentionally key up or interfere with the repeater. Memory Trick: &quot;Check the chart before you chat&quot; – consult the band plan or local list.
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-006
,
question,"If you are talking to a station using a repeater, how would you find out if you could communicate using simplex instead?"
optionA,By asking a third station to confirm it receives you both
optionB,By checking if you can clearly receive a more distant repeater
optionC,By asking the other station to move 10 kHz away to test the path
optionD,By checking if you can clearly receive the station on the repeater&apos;s input frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"If you can clearly hear the other station on the repeater&apos;s input frequency, that proves your direct path is good enough for simplex. Memory Trick: &quot;Hear them on input? Simplex will do it.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-007
,
question,"If you are operating simplex on a repeater frequency, why would it be good practice to change to another frequency?"
optionA,Because you may interfere with users of the repeater
optionB,Because the repeater&apos;s output power may overload your receiver
optionC,Because there are more repeater operators than simplex operators
optionD,"Because changing the repeater&apos;s frequency requires the authorization of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
correctOption,A
explanation,"Using a repeater output for simplex can block or confuse normal repeater use. Moving to a proper simplex channel avoids interfering with repeaters and their users. Memory Trick: &quot;Repeater channels are for repeaters, not for private chats.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-008
,
question,Which sideband is commonly used for 20-metre voice operation?
optionA,Double
optionB,Upper
optionC,Lower
optionD,Independent
correctOption,B
explanation,"On HF, amateur convention is USB (upper sideband) for 20&nbsp;metres and above, and LSB (lower sideband) on 40&nbsp;metres and below (with some exceptions). Memory Trick: &quot;Low bands = Lower, high bands = Upper.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-009
,
question,Which sideband is commonly used on 3755 kHz for voice operation?
optionA,Double
optionB,Upper
optionC,Lower
optionD,Independent
correctOption,C
explanation,"3755&nbsp;kHz is in the 80-metre band, where the usual sideband for amateur SSB voice is LSB (lower sideband). Memory Trick: &quot;Below 10&nbsp;MHz, think Lower sideband.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-010
,
question,"When calling a specific station on voice, what is the preferred format for your transmission?"
optionA,"CQ, CQ, CQ followed by the call sign of the desired station"
optionB,"Your call sign, followed by &quot;calling&quot; and the call sign of the desired station"
optionC,"Your call sign repeated twice, the word &quot;for&quot; and the call sign of the desired station"
optionD,"The call sign of the desired station, followed by &quot;this is&quot; and your call sign"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Standard practice is &quot;VA3XYZ, this is VE3ABC&quot; – called station first, then your ID. That makes it immediately clear whom you want to contact and who you are. Memory Trick: &quot;You then me&quot; format again."
BankQuestionID,B-002-003-011
,
question,What should you do before you transmit on any frequency?
optionA,Listen to make sure others are not using the frequency
optionB,Check your antenna for resonance at the selected frequency
optionC,Make sure the SWR on your transmission line is high enough
optionD,Increase power to ensure someone will hear you
correctOption,A
explanation,"The first step before transmitting is always to listen and confirm the frequency is clear, to avoid interfering with ongoing communications. Memory Trick: &quot;LBT&quot; – Listen Before Transmit."
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-001
,
question,"If you contact another station and your signal is extremely strong and perfectly readable, what adjustment should you make to your transmitter?"
optionA,"None, continue with your contact"
optionB,Turn down your power output to the minimum necessary
optionC,Turn on your speech processor
optionD,Bypass your antenna tuner
correctOption,B
explanation,"Amateur practice and regulations say you should use the minimum power necessary to maintain good communication. If you are &quot;20 over S9&quot;, you can usually reduce power and still be fully readable. Memory Trick: &quot;If you&apos;re booming in, back the power down.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-002
,
question,You need to transmit to adjust your antenna tuner prior to joining an HF single-sideband net that is in progress. On what frequency should you make the adjustment?
optionA,On the net frequency
optionB,On the band&apos;s centre frequency
optionC,3 kHz to 5 kHz away from the net frequency
optionD,1 kHz away from the net frequency
correctOption,C
explanation,"Tuning 3–5&nbsp;kHz away keeps your tuning bursts from disturbing the ongoing net, while still being close enough for your tuner settings to be correct when you move onto the net frequency. Memory Trick: &quot;Tune nearby, not right on top.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-003
,
question,How can on-the-air interference be minimized during lengthy transmitter testing?
optionA,Choose an unoccupied frequency
optionB,Use a non-resonant antenna
optionC,Use a resonant antenna
optionD,Use a dummy load
correctOption,D
explanation,"A dummy load lets you transmit at full power without radiating a signal, so you can test, tune, or troubleshoot without bothering anyone on the air. Memory Trick: &quot;If you&apos;re just testing, talk to the dummy (load), not the world.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-004
,
question,Why would you use a dummy load?
optionA,To test or adjust your transceiver without causing interference
optionB,To give comparative signal reports
optionC,It is faster to tune
optionD,To reduce output power
correctOption,A
explanation,"To test or adjust your transceiver without causing interference is correct because a dummy load lets your transmitter work at full power while almost no RF is radiated, so nobody hears your testing on the air. The other options misunderstand its purpose: it is not for reports, speed, or power reduction. Memory Trick: Think &quot;If I am only testing, talk to the dummy (load), not the world.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-005
,
question,"If you are the net control station of a daily HF net, what should you do if the frequency on which you normally meet is in use just before the net begins?"
optionA,Cancel the net for that day
optionB,"Ask occupants if they would change frequency, otherwise move to a clear frequency"
optionC,Reduce your output power and start the net as usual
optionD,Increase your power output so that net participants will be able to hear you over the existing activity
correctOption,B
explanation,"Ask occupants if they would change frequency, otherwise move to a clear frequency is correct because no one owns a frequency; you must share politely and avoid causing interference. Turning power up or down does not solve the basic problem of two groups on the same channel, and cancelling the net is unnecessary if a clear frequency can be found. Memory Trick: Net control rule: &quot;Ask or move, never shove.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-006
,
question,"If a net is about to begin on a frequency that you and another station are using, what should you do?"
optionA,Transmit as long as possible on the frequency so that no other stations may use it
optionB,Turn off your radio
optionC,"As a courtesy, move to a different frequency"
optionD,Increase your power output to ensure that all net participants can hear you
correctOption,C
explanation,"As a courtesy, move to a different frequency is correct because good operating practice avoids unnecessary conflict and leaves scheduled nets room to function. Power wars or deliberately holding the frequency are poor etiquette, and you do not have to shut down completely, just move. Memory Trick: &quot;When the net comes near, clear the gear.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-007
,
question,"If propagation changes during your contact and you notice increasing interference from other stations on the same frequency, what should you do?"
optionA,"Tell the interfering stations to change frequency, since you were there first"
optionB,Report the interference to your Section Manager at Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC)
optionC,Increase your output power
optionD,Move to another frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"Move to another frequency is correct because conditions can make distant QSOs suddenly overlap; the simplest cure is to QSY and avoid mutual interference. Being &quot;there first&quot; does not give you ownership, and complaining or raising power just adds to the mess. Memory Trick: Interference rule: &quot;If it gets crowded, slide away, not shout louder.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-008
,
question,"When selecting a single-sideband voice transmitting frequency, what minimum frequency separation from a contact in progress should you allow to minimize interference?"
optionA,Approximately 3 kHz
optionB,150 Hz to 500 Hz
optionC,Approximately 6 kHz
optionD,Approximately 10 kHz
correctOption,A
explanation,"Approximately 3 kHz is correct because an SSB signal typically occupies about 2.4–3 kHz of bandwidth, so being at least 3 kHz away keeps your audio from spilling into the other QSO. A 150–500 Hz separation is far too close, while 6–10 kHz is more than needed. Memory Trick: &quot;For SSB, think 3 kHz free.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-009
,
question,What is a band plan?
optionA,A schedule of additional band allocations for recommendation to the International Telecommunication Union
optionB,A voluntary division of an amateur radio band to avoid interference between incompatible modes
optionC,"A schedule of operating restrictions within a band prescribed by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
optionD,A plan devised by a club for the effective use of a frequency band during a contest
correctOption,B
explanation,"A voluntary division of an amateur radio band to avoid interference between incompatible modes is correct because band plans are agreed guidelines by amateurs (not laws) that group voice, CW, digital, repeaters, etc., into different segments. They are not official regulations or contest-only plans. Memory Trick: Band plan = &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement map&quot; of the band."
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-010
,
question,"Before transmitting, the first thing you should do is:"
optionA,make an announcement on the frequency indicating that you intend to make a call
optionB,decrease your receiver&apos;s volume
optionC,listen carefully so as not to interrupt communications already in progress
optionD,ask if the frequency is occupied
correctOption,C
explanation,Listen carefully so as not to interrupt communications already in progress is correct because &quot;listen before transmitting&quot; is the most basic on-air courtesy and helps you avoid doubling over someone. Asking if the frequency is in use comes after you have listened for a while. Memory Trick: LBT = &quot;Listen Before Transmit.&quot;
BankQuestionID,B-002-004-011
,
question,What is the correct way to call &quot;CQ&quot; when using Morse code?
optionA,"Send the letters &quot;CQ&quot; three times, followed by the word &quot;DE,&quot; followed by your call sign once"
optionB,"Send the letters &quot;CQ&quot; ten times, followed by the word &quot;DE,&quot; followed by your call sign once"
optionC,Send the letters &quot;CQ&quot; until someone answers
optionD,"Send the letters &quot;CQ&quot; three times, followed by the word &quot;DE,&quot; followed by your call sign three times"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Send the letters &quot;CQ&quot; three times, followed by &quot;DE&quot; and your call sign three times is correct because this standard pattern is easy to copy and clearly identifies who is calling. One call sign might be missed in QSB, and endlessly sending CQ wastes band space. Memory Trick: Same 3–3 pattern as voice: &quot;CQ CQ CQ DE VE3XXX VE3XXX VE3XXX.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-001
,
question,How should you answer a routine Morse code &quot;CQ&quot; call?
optionA,"Send the other station&apos;s call sign twice, followed by the word &quot;DE,&quot; followed by your call sign twice"
optionB,Send your call sign four times
optionC,"Send the other station&apos;s call sign once, followed by the word &quot;DE,&quot; followed by your call sign four times"
optionD,"Send your call sign followed by your name, station location and a signal report"
correctOption,A
explanation,"Send the other station&apos;s call sign twice, &quot;DE,&quot; then your call sign twice is correct because it immediately tells the CQ-ing station the call is for them and clearly identifies you. Just sending your call or a long introduction is less clear and less efficient. Memory Trick: &quot;You-you DE me-me&quot; on CW."
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-002
,
question,At what speed should a Morse code &quot;CQ&quot; call be transmitted?
optionA,At the highest speed at which you can control the keyer
optionB,At any speed which you can reliably receive
optionC,At the customary speed for the band
optionD,At the highest speed your keyer will operate
correctOption,B
explanation,"At any speed which you can reliably receive is correct because you must be able to copy replies to your own CQ. It does not matter what your keyer can send; if you cannot copy at that speed, the QSO will fail. Memory Trick: &quot;Send at the speed your ears, not your keyer, can handle.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-003
,
question,What is the meaning of &quot;CQ&quot;?
optionA,An antenna is being tested
optionB,The frequency is in use
optionC,Calling any station
optionD,Call on the quarter-hour
correctOption,C
explanation,Calling any station is correct because CQ is the general call inviting any operator listening to answer. It does not mean testing or frequency in use. Memory Trick: Think &quot;Seek you&quot; as a sound-alike for CQ = &quot;I seek any station.&quot;
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-004
,
question,What is the meaning of the word &quot;DE&quot; in Morse code?
optionA,Received all correctly
optionB,Calling any station
optionC,Directional Emissions
optionD,From
correctOption,D
explanation,"From is correct because &quot;DE&quot; is used to introduce the station sending, as in &quot;CQ CQ CQ DE VA3ABC&quot; meaning &quot;CQ ... from VA3ABC.&quot; It is not a Q-signal and does not mean &quot;all received.&quot; Memory Trick: Think of DE as the French &quot;de&quot; (&quot;from&quot;) – same idea."
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-005
,
question,What is the meaning of the Morse code signal &quot;K&quot;?
optionA,Any station please reply
optionB,End of message
optionC,Called station only reply
optionD,All received correctly
correctOption,A
explanation,"Any station please reply is correct because &quot;K&quot; invites a response from whoever is being called (or from any station, depending on context). &quot;AR&quot; means end of message, and &quot;R&quot; means received. Memory Trick: Hear &quot;K&quot; as &quot;OK, go ahead.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-006
,
question,What is meant by the term &quot;DX&quot;?
optionA,Best regards
optionB,Distant station
optionC,Calling any station
optionD,Go ahead
correctOption,B
explanation,"Distant station is correct because DX is ham shorthand for long-distance communication, typically outside your own country or region. It is not a procedure word like &quot;go ahead&quot; or a greeting. Memory Trick: DX = &quot;distance &times; extra&quot; – far away contacts."
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-007
,
question,What is the meaning of the term &quot;73&quot;?
optionA,Love and kisses
optionB,Go ahead
optionC,Best regards
optionD,Long distance
correctOption,C
explanation,"Best regards is correct because &quot;73&quot; is the traditional telegraphy sign-off meaning friendly regards. &quot;88&quot; is the one that means &quot;love and kisses,&quot; not 73. Memory Trick: 73 = &quot;best regards&quot;; 88 = &quot;hugs and kisses.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-008
,
question,Which of the following describes full break-in CW (QSK)?
optionA,Automatic keyers are used instead of hand keys
optionB,An operator must activate a manual send/receive switch before and after every transmission
optionC,Stations wishing to break in must send the Morse code signal &quot;BK&quot;
optionD,Incoming signals are received between transmitted dots and dashes
correctOption,D
explanation,Incoming signals are received between transmitted dots and dashes is correct because in full break-in (QSK) the transmitter and receiver switch fast enough that you can hear other stations while you are sending. It does not require manual switches or special &quot;BK&quot; use. Memory Trick: QSK = &quot;Quickly hear While Keying.&quot;
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-009
,
question,"When selecting a CW transmitting frequency, what minimum frequency separation from a contact in progress should you allow to minimize interference?"
optionA,150 Hz to 500 Hz
optionB,5 Hz to 50 Hz
optionC,1 kHz to 3 kHz
optionD,3 kHz to 6 kHz
correctOption,A
explanation,"150 Hz to 500 Hz is correct because CW signals are very narrow, typically a few tens of hertz wide, so a few hundred hertz separation is usually enough to prevent overlap. 1–3 kHz spacing is more than necessary for CW and is typical of SSB. Memory Trick: &quot;CW is thin, so a few hundred hertz keeps you in.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-010
,
question,What is the meaning of the Morse code signal &quot;R&quot;?
optionA,Repeat all
optionB,All received
optionC,End of message
optionD,Called station only reply
correctOption,B
explanation,"All received is correct because &quot;R&quot; acknowledges that you copied the previous transmission, similar to &quot;roger&quot; in voice. &quot;AR&quot; (&middot; &ndash; &middot; &ndash; &middot;) means end of message, and &quot;AGN&quot; (again) would ask for a repeat. Memory Trick: R = &quot;Received.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-005-011
,
question,What do &quot;RST&quot; signal reports describe?
optionA,Sunspot activity
optionB,Ionospheric conditions
optionC,Signal reception
optionD,Transmitter power
correctOption,C
explanation,"Signal reception is correct because RST reports describe how well the other station&apos;s signal is being received: how readable it is, how strong it is, and (for CW) how clean the tone is. They do not directly describe power, sunspots, or propagation conditions, only what you actually hear. Memory Trick: Think &quot;RST = Receiving Signal Test&quot; to remember it is about what you hear at your receiver."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-001
,
question,What does &quot;RST&quot; stand for in a signal report?
optionA,"Recovery, signal strength, tempo"
optionB,"Recovery, signal speed, tone"
optionC,"Readability, signal speed, tempo"
optionD,"Readability, signal strength, tone"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Readability, signal strength, tone is correct because the R digit (1–5) describes how easy the signal is to copy, the S digit (1–9) is its strength, and the T digit (1–9, for CW) describes the purity of the tone. The other options use words that are not part of the standard reporting system. Memory Trick: R = Readable, S = Strong, T = Tone."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-002
,
question,What is the meaning of: &quot;Your signal report is 5 7&quot;?
optionA,Your signal is perfectly readable and moderately strong
optionB,Your signal is readable with considerable difficulty
optionC,Your signal is perfectly readable with near pure tone
optionD,"Your signal is perfectly readable, but weak"
correctOption,A
explanation,"Your signal is perfectly readable and moderately strong is correct because R = 5 means &quot;perfectly readable&quot; and S = 7 is a moderately strong signal on the S scale. Tone is not part of a normal voice R S report, so the other tone based interpretation is incorrect here. Memory Trick: Think &quot;5 = fine copy, 7 = solid but not blasting.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-003
,
question,What is the meaning of: &quot;Your signal report is 3 3&quot;?
optionA,The contact is serial number 33
optionB,Your signal is readable with considerable difficulty and weak in strength
optionC,"Your signal is unreadable, very weak in strength"
optionD,The station is located at latitude 33 degrees
correctOption,B
explanation,"Your signal is readable with considerable difficulty and weak in strength is correct because R = 3 means you can copy it, but it is hard work, and S = 3 means the signal is weak. The other choices confuse the RST numbers with unrelated numbering. Memory Trick: &quot;3 3&quot; = &quot;hard to hear and weak&quot; on both counts."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-004
,
question,What is the meaning of: &quot;You are 5 9 plus 20 dB&quot;?
optionA,Repeat your transmission on a frequency 20 kHz higher
optionB,Your signal strength has increased by a factor of 100
optionC,You are perfectly readable with a signal strength 20 decibels greater than S9
optionD,The bandwidth of your signal is 20 decibels above linearity
correctOption,C
explanation,"You are perfectly readable with a signal strength 20 decibels greater than S9 is correct because &quot;5 9&quot; is the standard &quot;loud and clear&quot; report, and &quot;plus 20 dB&quot; means the S meter is 20 dB above its S9 calibration point. It does not tell you to change frequency. Memory Trick: &quot;5 9 plus something&quot; always means &quot;very strong and very clear,&quot; with the &quot;plus&quot; number showing how far above S9."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-005
,
question,A distant station asks for a signal report on a local repeater you monitor. What do you report?
optionA,Your S-meter reading on the repeater output frequency
optionB,Your S-meter reading on the repeater input frequency
optionC,The readability and strength of the repeater signal
optionD,The quality of the station&apos;s signal and audio as heard through the repeater
correctOption,D
explanation,"The quality of the station&apos;s signal and audio as heard through the repeater is correct because the useful information is how well that station is being repeated at your end. The S meter tells you more about the repeater output than about the original station. Memory Trick: On a repeater, you always report &quot;how you sound coming out of the machine.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-006
,
question,"Your receiver&apos;s S-meter is calibrated to a standard of 6 dB per S-unit per a recommendation by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). The S-meter shows S9 when receiving a station transmitting with 100 watts. Neglecting propagation changes, what transmitter power would cause your receiver&apos;s S-meter to read S8?"
optionA,25 watts
optionB,75 watts
optionC,50 watts
optionD,33 watts
correctOption,A
explanation,"25 watts is correct because a one S unit change (from S9 down to S8) is 6 dB, and a 6 dB decrease in power is a reduction by a factor of 4. One quarter of 100 watts is 25 watts. Memory Trick: Remember &quot;6 dB = 4 times&quot; power change; going down one S unit means divide power by 4."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-007
,
question,Assume your receiver&apos;s S-meter is calibrated to a standard of 6 dB per S-unit per a recommendation by the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). The S-meter on your receiver shows S8 when listening to a nearby transmitter. Approximately how much must the transmitter power be raised to increase the reading to S9?
optionA,2 times
optionB,4 times
optionC,5 times
optionD,3 times
correctOption,B
explanation,"4 times is correct because going up one S unit (S8 to S9) is an increase of 6 dB on a properly calibrated meter, and 6 dB corresponds to four times the power. The other factors do not match the standard dB to power relationship. Memory Trick: &quot;One S step up = 4 times the power.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-008
,
question,What does &quot;RST 579&quot; mean in a Morse code contact?
optionA,"Your signal is fairly readable, fair strength, and with perfect tone"
optionB,"Your signal is barely readable, moderately strong, and with a faint ripple"
optionC,"Your signal is perfectly readable, moderately strong, and with perfect tone"
optionD,"Your signal is perfectly readable, weak strength, and with perfect tone"
correctOption,C
explanation,"Your signal is perfectly readable, moderately strong, and with perfect tone is correct because R = 5 means &quot;perfectly readable,&quot; S = 7 means &quot;moderately strong,&quot; and T = 9 is &quot;perfect tone.&quot; The other choices change either the readability or strength numbers. Memory Trick: 5 7 9 is the &quot;good solid CW&quot; report: clear, good strength, clean tone."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-009
,
question,What does &quot;RST 459&quot; mean in a Morse code contact?
optionA,"Your signal is very readable, very strong, and with perfect tone"
optionB,"Your signal is barely readable, very weak, and with perfect tone"
optionC,"Your signal is moderately readable, very weak, and with hum on the tone"
optionD,"Your signal is quite readable, fair strength, and with perfect tone"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Your signal is quite readable, fair strength, and with perfect tone is correct because R = 4 means &quot;readable with practically no difficulty,&quot; S = 5 is &quot;fair strength,&quot; and T = 9 again indicates a pure tone. The other answers misinterpret the R, S, or T values. Memory Trick: 4 5 9 is &quot;almost 5 5 9&quot;: good copy, middling strength, clean tone."
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-010
,
question,"In voice contacts, what is the meaning of &quot;Your signal report is 1 1&quot;?"
optionA,"Your signal is unreadable, and barely perceptible"
optionB,Your signal is 11 dB over S9
optionC,Your signal is moderately readable with moderate strength
optionD,Your signal is very readable and very strong
correctOption,A
explanation,"Your signal is unreadable, and barely perceptible is correct because R = 1 is &quot;unreadable&quot; and S = 1 is &quot;faint, barely perceptible.&quot; It does not describe an S meter reading above S9. Memory Trick: &quot;1 1&quot; = &quot;almost nothing there.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-006-011
,
question,What does the code &quot;QRS&quot; mean in amateur radio?
optionA,Radio station location is ...
optionB,Send more slowly
optionC,Interference from static
optionD,Send &quot;RST&quot; report
correctOption,B
explanation,"Send more slowly is correct because QRS specifically requests the other operator to reduce their sending speed in CW. It has nothing to do with static, signal reports, or locations. Memory Trick: Think &quot;QRS = Quick? Reduce Speed.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-001
,
question,What does the code &quot;QTH&quot; mean in amateur radio?
optionA,My name is ...
optionB,Time here is ...
optionC,My location is ...
optionD,Stop sending
correctOption,C
explanation,My location is ... is correct because QTH is the Q code used to give or ask for a station&apos;s location. It does not refer to name or time. Memory Trick: QTH = &quot;Q-Topographic Home&quot; to remember it is about where you are.
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-002
,
question,What is the proper Q code to use to see if a frequency is in use before transmitting on CW?
optionA,QRV?
optionB,QRU?
optionC,QRZ?
optionD,QRL?
correctOption,D
explanation,"QRL? is correct because it means &quot;Is this frequency in use?&quot; and is the standard CW way of checking before you call. QRV means &quot;I am ready,&quot; QRU means &quot;I have nothing for you,&quot; and QRZ means &quot;Who is calling me?&quot; Memory Trick: QRL = &quot;Q, is this frequency already in use?&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-003
,
question,What does the code &quot;QSY&quot; mean in amateur radio?
optionA,Change frequency
optionB,Use more power
optionC,Send faster
optionD,Send more slowly
correctOption,A
explanation,"Change frequency is correct because QSY means moving to another frequency or asking someone else to move. It is not related to power or speed. Memory Trick: QSY = &quot;Q, Shift Your frequency.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-004
,
question,What does the code &quot;QSB&quot; mean in amateur radio?
optionA,I am confirming contact
optionB,Your signal is fading
optionC,I am busy
optionD,I have no message
correctOption,B
explanation,"Your signal is fading is correct because QSB is used when signals slowly rise and fall due to propagation changes. It does not mean busy, empty, or confirmed. Memory Trick: QSB = &quot;Signal Bouncing&quot; up and down."
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-005
,
question,What is the correct Q code to ask who is calling you?
optionA,QRL?
optionB,QRT?
optionC,QRZ?
optionD,QSL?
correctOption,C
explanation,"QRZ? is correct because it means &quot;Who is calling me?&quot; and is often used when several stations call at once or the operator did not catch the call sign. QSL is about confirming, QRL is about frequency in use, and QRT means stopping transmission. Memory Trick: QRZ = &quot;Who aRe you?&quot; on CW."
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-006
,
question,What does the code &quot;QRM&quot; mean in amateur radio?
optionA,I am troubled by static
optionB,Your signals are fading
optionC,I am busy
optionD,I am being interfered with
correctOption,D
explanation,"I am being interfered with is correct because QRM refers to man made interference from other stations. Static noise from nature is QRN, not QRM. Memory Trick: QRM = &quot;Radio Men&quot; interfering (man made signals)."
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-007
,
question,What does the code &quot;QRN&quot; mean in amateur radio?
optionA,I am troubled by static
optionB,I am busy
optionC,I will call you
optionD,I am being interfered with
correctOption,A
explanation,I am troubled by static is correct because QRN refers to natural noise like thunderstorms or atmospheric static. QRM is the code for interference from other stations. Memory Trick: QRN = &quot;Noise&quot; from Nature.
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-008
,
question,What is the Q code indicating that you want the other station to send slower?
optionA,QRN
optionB,QRS
optionC,QRM
optionD,QRL
correctOption,B
explanation,"QRS is correct because it means &quot;Send more slowly.&quot; QRM is about interference, QRL is about the frequency being busy, and QRN is static. Memory Trick: QRS = &quot;Reduce Speed.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-009
,
question,What is the Q code that means &quot;Who is calling me?&quot; in amateur radio?
optionA,QRP?
optionB,QRM?
optionC,QRZ?
optionD,QRK?
correctOption,C
explanation,"QRZ? is correct because it means &quot;Who is calling me?&quot; and is used when you know someone is calling but did not fully copy their call sign. The other Q codes refer to readability (QRK), low power (QRP), or interference (QRM). Memory Trick: Think &quot;QRZ = Who aRe you?&quot; when you did not catch the caller."
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-010
,
question,What is the Q code that means &quot;I will call you again&quot; in amateur radio?
optionA,QRZ
optionB,QRS
optionC,QRT
optionD,QRX
correctOption,D
explanation,"QRX is correct because it means &quot;I will call you again&quot; or &quot;Stand by, I will call you later.&quot; QRZ means &quot;Who is calling me?&quot;, QRS means &quot;Send more slowly&quot;, and QRT means &quot;Stop sending&quot;. Memory Trick: QRX = &quot;Q, Reminder neXt time&quot; &mdash; I will call you again."
BankQuestionID,B-002-007-011
,
question,When may you use your amateur radio station to transmit an &quot;SOS&quot; or &quot;MAYDAY&quot;?
optionA,In a life-threatening distress situation
optionB,Never
optionC,Only at specific times (at 15 and 30 minutes after the hour)
optionD,Only in case of a severe weather watch
correctOption,A
explanation,"In a life-threatening distress situation is correct because SOS and MAYDAY are reserved for immediate danger to life or serious risk to a vessel, aircraft, or person. Using them in non life-threatening situations is illegal and can delay help to real emergencies. Memory Trick: &quot;MAYDAY&quot; = &quot;My life is in danger&quot; &mdash; anything less is not MAYDAY."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-001
,
question,"You need to summon help while stranded in a remote location, but without immediate risk to life. What priority is your message?"
optionA,Welfare
optionB,Urgent
optionC,Distress
optionD,Safety
correctOption,B
explanation,"Urgent is correct because urgency traffic covers very important situations that are not yet immediately life threatening, while distress is reserved strictly for current danger to life. Safety and welfare traffic are lower in priority. Memory Trick: Order them in your mind as Distress &gt; Urgent &gt; Safety/Welfare."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-002
,
question,"What voice signal, transmitted three times, signifies distress?"
optionA,EMERGENCY
optionB,HELP
optionC,MAYDAY
optionD,SOS
correctOption,C
explanation,"MAYDAY is correct because &quot;MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY&quot; is the internationally recognized voice distress call for life threatening emergencies. SOS is used as a Morse code distress signal, and the words EMERGENCY or HELP by themselves do not have the same formal, protected meaning. Memory Trick: Voice = MAYDAY, Morse = SOS."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-003
,
question,What is the correct distress signal in Morse code?
optionA,CQD
optionB,QRRR
optionC,MAYDAY
optionD,SOS
correctOption,D
explanation,SOS is correct because the Morse pattern &quot;SOS&quot; (&quot;dit dit dit dah dah dah dit dit dit&quot;) is the standard global distress signal in Morse. CQD and other older codes are obsolete and no longer used as the official distress call. Memory Trick: Remember the simple three three three pattern of SOS.
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-004
,
question,What is the correct way to interrupt a repeater conversation to seek assistance in a distress situation?
optionA,Break in between transmissions to state your call sign and situation
optionB,Say &quot;EMERGENCY&quot; three times
optionC,"Say &quot;SOS,&quot; then your call sign"
optionD,Say &quot;HELP&quot; as many times as it takes to get someone to answer
correctOption,A
explanation,"Break in between transmissions to state your call sign and situation is correct because you should clearly identify yourself and briefly describe the emergency so that others can assist or relay. Shouting random words may confuse other operators or be misunderstood. Memory Trick: Wait for a pause, then &quot;CALLSIGN &mdash; EMERGENCY&quot; with short, clear facts."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-005
,
question,What is the advantage of preparing to operate your station without commercial AC power?
optionA,So you may use your station while mobile
optionB,So you may provide communications during a power outage
optionC,So you will comply with the rules
optionD,So you may operate in contests where AC power is not allowed
correctOption,B
explanation,"So you may provide communications during a power outage is correct because emergency and public service work often occurs when mains power has failed. Having batteries, generators, or solar power lets you keep operating when others cannot. Memory Trick: &quot;No mains = your station becomes the lifeline.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-006
,
question,"In an emergency, what additional equipment is crucial to maintaining communications with a hand held radio?"
optionA,A portable amplifier
optionB,A microphone headset for hands free operation
optionC,An adequate supply of charged batteries
optionD,An extra antenna
correctOption,C
explanation,"An adequate supply of charged batteries is correct because a hand held radio is useless once its battery is drained. Extra antennas or amplifiers may help performance, but power is the limiting factor in extended emergencies. Memory Trick: For handhelds, &quot;No volts = no voice.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-007
,
question,Which type of antenna would be a good choice as part of a portable HF station that could be set up in case of an emergency?
optionA,A parabolic dish
optionB,A three element Yagi
optionC,A three element quad
optionD,A dipole or a vertical
correctOption,D
explanation,"A dipole or a vertical is correct because both are relatively simple, lightweight, and quick to install in temporary or emergency locations, while still providing good performance. Multi element beams and dishes are heavier, more complex, and harder to erect in a hurry. Memory Trick: In emergencies think &quot;simple wire or simple vertical,&quot; not big towers."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-008
,
question,"If you are communicating with another station and hear a station in distress break in, what should you do?"
optionA,Acknowledge the station in distress and determine its location and what assistance may be needed
optionB,Continue your communication because you were on frequency first
optionC,Change to a different frequency so the station in distress may have a clear channel to call for assistance
optionD,Immediately cease all transmissions because stations in distress have emergency rights to the frequency
correctOption,A
explanation,"Acknowledge the station in distress and determine its location and what assistance may be needed is correct because your first duty is to help coordinate aid or relay the information if others can help more effectively. Simply leaving the frequency may result in nobody answering the distress call. Memory Trick: Hear distress = respond, gather facts, then help or relay."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-009
,
question,"In order of priority, a distress message comes before:"
optionA,a safety message
optionB,an emergency message
optionC,no other messages
optionD,a government priority message
correctOption,B
explanation,"An emergency message is correct because in standard radio traffic priority, distress traffic (immediate danger to life) is highest, followed by urgent or emergency messages, then safety and routine traffic. This is true even compared to most other government or routine priority traffic. Memory Trick: Remember &quot;Life first&quot; at the top of any priority list."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-010
,
question,If you hear distress traffic and are unable to render direct assistance you should:
optionA,take no action
optionB,tell all other stations to cease transmitting
optionC,contact authorities and maintain watch in case your assistance is needed
optionD,enter the details in the logbook and take no further action
correctOption,C
explanation,"Contact authorities and maintain watch in case your assistance is needed is correct because even if you cannot help directly, you can pass the information to the appropriate rescue or safety organization and continue to monitor in case you can relay further details. Memory Trick: &quot;Hear MAYDAY = Inform and Monitor&quot; even if you cannot personally respond."
BankQuestionID,B-002-008-011
,
question,What is a &quot;QSL card&quot;?
optionA,"A notice of an apparent infraction from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"
optionB,A postcard reminding you when your certificate will expire
optionC,A letter or postcard from an amateur radio operator
optionD,A written proof of communication between two amateur radio operators
correctOption,D
explanation,"A written proof of communication between two amateur radio operators is correct because QSL cards serve as confirmations of contacts, often used for awards or as souvenirs. They are not official notices from regulators. Memory Trick: QSL = &quot;I confirm receipt&quot; &mdash; so a QSL card is a &quot;contact confirmed&quot; card."
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-001
,
question,What is an azimuthal map?
optionA,A map projection centred on a given location
optionB,A map projection displaying Maidenhead grid squares
optionC,A map projection centred on the magnetic North Pole
optionD,A map projection centred on the geographic North Pole
correctOption,A
explanation,"A map projection centred on a given location is correct because an azimuthal map shows the world as seen from one central point, with directions and great circle paths radiating from that point. This is useful in amateur radio for aiming directional antennas. Memory Trick: Think &quot;Azimuthal = All directions from me.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-002
,
question,"While making a contact in a VHF contest, the other operator asks for your grid square. What information is requested?"
optionA,The elevation of your station in thirty metre increments
optionB,Your location expressed as a 4 or 6 character code
optionC,Your antenna azimuth stated in compass degrees
optionD,The number of contacts you have made
correctOption,B
explanation,"Your location expressed as a 4 or 6 character code is correct because grid squares (Maidenhead locators) encode latitude and longitude into a short code such as &quot;FN25&quot; or &quot;FN25dk&quot;. They are not counts, elevation, or antenna headings. Memory Trick: &quot;What grid?&quot; = &quot;What coded location?&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-003
,
question,A directional antenna pointed in the long path direction to another station is generally oriented how many degrees from its short path heading?
optionA,90 degrees
optionB,270 degrees
optionC,180 degrees
optionD,45 degrees
correctOption,C
explanation,180 degrees is correct because the long path is roughly the opposite direction around the Earth from the short path. Turning 180 degrees points the antenna along the other great circle route between the two stations. Memory Trick: Short path vs long path = &quot;front&quot; and &quot;exactly opposite&quot; (180 degrees).
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-004
,
question,What method is used by amateur radio operators to provide proof of communication with another station?
optionA,"A letter detailing contact date, time, frequency, mode and power"
optionB,A radiogram sent over amateur radio traffic nets
optionC,A brief email or text message
optionD,A QSL card or entries in web based logging systems
correctOption,D
explanation,"A QSL card or entries in web based logging systems is correct because these are the standard, widely accepted methods for confirming contacts, especially for awards and DX records. Letters or casual emails are not normally used as formal proof. Memory Trick: Think &quot;QSL card or online QSL&quot; as your official contact receipt."
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-005
,
question,"Local stations are in contact with New Zealand, yet you cannot hear the New Zealand amateur radio operators with your antenna pointed in that direction. What other antenna direction could you try to hear them?"
optionA,Point your antenna 180 degrees from the current bearing
optionB,Point your antenna 90 degrees west of the current bearing
optionC,Point your antenna 90 degrees east of the current bearing
optionD,Point your antenna further south
correctOption,A
explanation,Point your antenna 180 degrees from the current bearing is correct because sometimes propagation is better via the long path rather than the short path. Pointing 180 degrees opposite gives you a chance to work the same station by the other great circle route. Memory Trick: &quot;No luck short? Try the opposite direction for long path.&quot;
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-006
,
question,Which statement about recording all contacts and unanswered CQ calls in a paper or computer based station logbook is NOT correct?
optionA,A logbook is important for handling neighbour interference complaints
optionB,A logbook is a regulatory requirement
optionC,A logbook is important for recording contacts for operating awards
optionD,A well kept logbook preserves your fondest amateur radio memories for years
correctOption,B
explanation,"A logbook is a regulatory requirement is the NOT correct statement because in Canada there is no general legal requirement to keep a logbook for ordinary amateur operation, although it is strongly recommended. The other statements describe real practical benefits of logging. Memory Trick: &quot;Good practice, not law&quot; &mdash; logging helps you, but is usually not mandatory."
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-007
,
question,What is the most useful function of an azimuthal world map centred on your location?
optionA,To associate distances with optimal ionospheric region
optionB,To show the azimuth to meteor showers throughout the year
optionC,To show the bearing to any location
optionD,To allow computing the radiation angle to any location
correctOption,C
explanation,"To show the bearing to any location is correct because an azimuthal map centred on your QTH lets you read the compass heading (azimuth) directly from you to any DX location. The other options talk about angles, ionospheric layers, or meteor showers, which are not what this map is primarily for. Memory Trick: Azimuthal map = azimuth (compass bearing) from me."
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-008
,
question,"Activity schedules, time entries in logbooks and contact confirmations usually refer to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). What is the location of the meridian from which this time is measured?"
optionA,"Geneva, Switzerland"
optionB,"Ottawa, Canada"
optionC,"Boulder, United States of America"
optionD,"Greenwich, United Kingdom"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Greenwich, United Kingdom is correct because UTC is based on the zero degree longitude line, historically called the Greenwich Meridian. The other cities are important technically or politically, but not the reference for UTC. Memory Trick: Think of UTC as &quot;Greenwich Mean Time&quot; modernized."
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-009
,
question,Your time zone is UTC minus 6 hours. You want to join a net scheduled for 19:00 UTC. What is the local scheduled time?
optionA,1:00 PM
optionB,1 AM (tomorrow)
optionC,7:00 PM
optionD,7 AM (tomorrow)
correctOption,A
explanation,"1:00 PM is correct because you subtract 6 hours from 19:00 UTC: 19 − 6 = 13, which is 13:00 (1 PM) local time the same day. The other answers either add hours or shift to the wrong time of day. Memory Trick: Local time = UTC − 6, so &quot;19 minus 6 equals 13&quot;."
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-010
,
question,"What is the usefulness of stations CHU, WWV and WWVH to amateur radio operators?"
optionA,Provide amateur radio bulletins
optionB,Provide accurate and precise frequency and time signals
optionC,Provide received signal reports of your transmissions
optionD,Provide forecasts of band conditions
correctOption,B
explanation,"Provide accurate and precise frequency and time signals is correct because CHU, WWV and WWVH transmit standard time and frequency signals that hams can use to set clocks and check frequency calibration. They may also announce propagation info, but their primary role is standards, not reports or bulletins. Memory Trick: Think &quot;WWV = World Wide time and frequency.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-002-009-011
,
question,"To be most effective, where should a low-pass filter be connected in an HF station without an external power amplifier?"
optionA,Between the antenna tuner and the antenna switch
optionB,As close as possible to the antenna switch output
optionC,As close as possible to the transceiver output
optionD,Between the SWR meter and the antenna tuner
correctOption,C
explanation,"As close as possible to the transceiver output is correct because the low pass filter should clean up the signal (remove harmonics) immediately after it is generated, before it goes into the rest of the RF chain. Placing it later may allow harmonics to be radiated or cause problems in other equipment. Memory Trick: First clean it, then send it down the line."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-001
,
question,"In an HF station that includes an external RF power amplifier, where should a low-pass filter be located?"
optionA,Between the SWR meter and the antenna tuner
optionB,Between the antenna tuner and the antenna switch
optionC,As close as possible to the transceiver output
optionD,As close as possible to the external amplifier output
correctOption,D
explanation,"As close as possible to the external amplifier output is correct because the amplifier can also generate harmonics. The filter must sit right after the last stage that can create unwanted high frequency components. Filtering only at the exciter output (the transceiver) is not enough. Memory Trick: Last RF stage, then low-pass, then antenna."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-002
,
question,Why do modern HF transmitters have a built-in low-pass filter in their RF output circuits?
optionA,To reduce harmonic emissions
optionB,To reduce fundamental emission
optionC,To reduce adjacent channel interference
optionD,To reduce RF energy below a cut-off point
correctOption,A
explanation,"To reduce harmonic emissions is correct because a low pass filter passes the wanted fundamental frequency and attenuates higher harmonic frequencies that would cause interference on other bands and services. It is not meant to reduce the main carrier itself. Memory Trick: Low-pass = let the main (low) band through, knock the high harmonics down."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-003
,
question,Which component in an HF station is used to determine if the antenna system impedance is matched to the transmitter?
optionA,S-meter
optionB,SWR meter
optionC,Frequency meter
optionD,Multimeter
correctOption,B
explanation,"SWR meter is correct because it measures the standing wave ratio on the feed line, which directly indicates how well the antenna system impedance is matched to the transmitter. Frequency meters, multimeters and S-meters do not measure line matching. Memory Trick: SWR = Standing Wave Ratio = &quot;how well the antenna line is matched.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-004
,
question,What is the purpose of the antenna switch in an HF station?
optionA,To adjust the impedance of the antenna system
optionB,To select the orientation of the antenna
optionC,To select the desired antenna or dummy load
optionD,To adjust the antenna operating frequency
correctOption,C
explanation,"To select the desired antenna or dummy load is correct because an antenna switch simply routes the transmitter output to one of several antennas or to a dummy load. It does not tune, match, or rotate the antenna. Memory Trick: Switch = choose the path, not change the antenna itself."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-005
,
question,"In an HF station, what device might allow the use of an antenna on a band it was not designed for?"
optionA,A low-pass filter
optionB,A high-pass filter
optionC,An SWR meter
optionD,An antenna tuner
correctOption,D
explanation,"An antenna tuner is correct because it adjusts the impedance seen by the transmitter so that it can safely feed an antenna that is not resonant on that band. Filters only shape spectrum, and an SWR meter only measures match; neither one corrects the mismatch. Memory Trick: &quot;Tuner tunes, meter measures.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-006
,
question,"In an HF station, which component is designed to dissipate RF energy and prevent radiation?"
optionA,Dummy load
optionB,Lightning surge protector
optionC,Low-pass filter
optionD,Heat sink
correctOption,A
explanation,"Dummy load is correct because it is a non-radiating 50 ohm (typically) load that converts RF power into heat so you can test or tune without radiating a signal. A lightning protector is for surges, a low pass filter shapes spectrum, and a heat sink only removes heat from components. Memory Trick: Dummy load = &quot;invisible antenna&quot; that only makes heat."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-007
,
question,"In an HF station, right after which component is the SWR meter inserted?"
optionA,The antenna switch
optionB,The low-pass filter
optionC,The last stage of RF amplification
optionD,The antenna tuner
correctOption,B
explanation,"The low-pass filter is correct because the usual order is: transmitter and final amplifier → low pass filter (to clean harmonics) → SWR meter (to monitor the signal going to the system) → tuner/switch → antenna. Placing the SWR meter after the filter lets you see what is actually being fed toward the antenna system. Memory Trick: Clean it, then measure it, then send it."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-008
,
question,"When using an HF transmitter with a solid-state final amplifier, which station component may need to be adjusted when changing frequency?"
optionA,SWR meter
optionB,Dummy load
optionC,Antenna tuner
optionD,Low-pass filter
correctOption,C
explanation,"Antenna tuner is correct because when you change frequency, the antenna system may no longer be well matched, and the tuner must be readjusted to keep the SWR low and protect sensitive solid-state finals. The SWR meter and dummy load do not need &quot;adjustment&quot;, and built-in filters are usually switched automatically. Memory Trick: New frequency, new tune."
BankQuestionID,B-003-001-009
,
question,What does the microphone produce in an FM transmitter?
optionA,An electrical signal driving the oscillator
optionB,A radio frequency signal driving the speech amplifier
optionC,A radio frequency signal driving the power amplifier
optionD,An electrical signal driving the speech amplifier
correctOption,D
explanation,"An electrical signal driving the speech amplifier is correct because the microphone converts sound (air pressure changes) into a low level audio voltage, which is then amplified and used to modulate the RF stages. The mic never generates RF itself. Memory Trick: Mic = audio only; RF is created later."
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-001
,
question,The microphone of an FM transmitter:
optionA,produces an electrical signal from air pressure changes
optionB,is quieter than AM or SSB microphones
optionC,has a different tone than other microphones
optionD,has a wider frequency range than other microphones
correctOption,A
explanation,"Produces an electrical signal from air pressure changes is correct because that is the basic function of any microphone: sound in, small audio voltage out. FM, AM and SSB microphones all work on the same physical principle; the mode is decided later in the transmitter. Memory Trick: Microphone = &quot;air to volts&quot; device."
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-002
,
question,An FM transmitter's modulator:
optionA,produces amplitude changes in the oscillator
optionB,affects the frequency of the oscillator
optionC,has no effect on the frequency of the oscillator
optionD,alters the radio's output signal amplitude
correctOption,B
explanation,"Affects the frequency of the oscillator is correct because in frequency modulation (FM) the information is carried by changing the instantaneous frequency of the carrier, not its amplitude. The other options describe AM or no modulation at all. Memory Trick: FM = Frequency Moves."
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-003
,
question,"How is the oscillator in the FM transmitter different from oscillators in AM, CW, and SSB transmitters?"
optionA,It has higher fidelity
optionB,The modulator changes its output amplitude
optionC,The modulator alters its frequency
optionD,It runs at much higher frequencies
correctOption,C
explanation,The modulator alters its frequency is correct because in an FM transmitter the audio signal causes the oscillator frequency to swing slightly above and below the centre frequency. In AM/SSB/CW systems the oscillator frequency is usually fixed and the amplitude or envelope is changed instead. Memory Trick: FM oscillator = &quot;wiggling frequency&quot; instead of &quot;wiggling height.&quot;
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-004
,
question,"In an FM transmitter, the frequency multiplier:"
optionA,allows the oscillator to be run at very high frequencies
optionB,is the major load fed by the power supply
optionC,produces a low distortion audio response
optionD,produces the FM output carrier frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"Produces the FM output carrier frequency is correct because the oscillator often runs at a lower frequency where modulation is easier and more stable, and a frequency multiplier (or chain of them) multiplies that modulated signal up to the final transmit frequency. The other options confuse its role with power or audio stages. Memory Trick: Multiplier = &quot;frequency stretcher&quot; that gets you to the band you want."
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-005
,
question,"In an FM transmitter, which stage produces a useful harmonic?"
optionA,Frequency multiplier
optionB,Modulator
optionC,Power amplifier
optionD,Speech amplifier
correctOption,A
explanation,"Frequency multiplier is correct because it is specifically designed and tuned to use harmonics of the oscillator to generate a higher transmit frequency. Random harmonics from other stages are usually unwanted. Memory Trick: Only the multiplier wants harmonics; everywhere else, harmonics are trouble."
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-006
,
question,"In an FM transmitter, which stage draws the most electric power?"
optionA,Speech amplifier
optionB,Power amplifier
optionC,Frequency multiplier
optionD,Oscillator
correctOption,B
explanation,"Power amplifier is correct because it must deliver significant RF power to the antenna, so it draws the largest current from the power supply. Oscillator, speech amplifier, and multiplier stages operate at much lower power levels. Memory Trick: The stage that sends power to the antenna is the stage that eats most of the power from the supply."
BankQuestionID,B-003-002-007
,
question,"In a superheterodyne receiver, which stage is called the front-end?"
optionA,AF amplifier
optionB,Limiter
optionC,RF amplifier
optionD,Local oscillator
correctOption,C
explanation,RF amplifier is correct because the &quot;front end&quot; is the first RF stage that the antenna signal meets. It sets the overall sensitivity and noise figure before the signal is converted to the IF. The other stages come later in the signal chain. Memory Trick: Front end = first RF stage after the antenna.
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-001
,
question,"In a VHF superheterodyne receiver, which stage must be designed to produce very little noise?"
optionA,Product detector
optionB,IF amplifier
optionC,Limiter
optionD,RF amplifier
correctOption,D
explanation,"RF amplifier is correct because noise added in the very first RF stage dominates the whole receiver's noise figure, especially at VHF. Later stages cannot &quot;fix&quot; noise that is already added. Memory Trick: Quietest stage must be the very first one."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-002
,
question,"In a superheterodyne receiver, which stage allows detection to function at a single frequency regardless of the received frequency?"
optionA,Mixer
optionB,Limiter
optionC,IF filter
optionD,Discriminator
correctOption,A
explanation,"Mixer is correct because it combines the incoming RF with the local oscillator to create a fixed intermediate frequency (IF). Detectors and IF filters can then be optimized for that single IF, no matter what RF you tune. Memory Trick: Mixer makes &quot;many RF channels&quot; into one standard IF."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-003
,
question,"In a superheterodyne receiver, which stage sets the received frequency?"
optionA,Beat frequency oscillator
optionB,Local oscillator
optionC,RF amplifier
optionD,IF filter
correctOption,B
explanation,"Local oscillator is correct because changing its frequency changes the difference between LO and RF, and therefore which RF frequency is converted to the IF. The IF filter stays fixed. Memory Trick: You tune the LO, and the LO chooses which station gets mixed to IF."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-004
,
question,"In a superheterodyne receiver, which stage rejects signals on adjacent channels?"
optionA,Limiter
optionB,Product detector
optionC,IF filter
optionD,Mixer
correctOption,C
explanation,"IF filter is correct because most of the selectivity in a superhet comes from sharp, fixed-frequency filters in the IF chain. They pass the wanted channel and greatly attenuate nearby ones. Memory Trick: &quot;Selectivity lives in the IF.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-005
,
question,"In a superheterodyne receiver, which stage provides the final signal power to drive the detector?"
optionA,RF amplifier
optionB,Speech amplifier
optionC,Frequency multiplier
optionD,IF amplifier
correctOption,D
explanation,"IF amplifier is correct because it boosts the intermediate-frequency signal to the level needed for the detector to work properly. The RF amplifier works earlier in the chain, and the audio (speech) amplifier comes after detection. Memory Trick: RF → mixer → IF amp → detector → audio."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-006
,
question,"In an FM receiver, what is the purpose of the limiter?"
optionA,Remove amplitude variations from the received signal
optionB,Suppress local oscillator harmonics
optionC,Prevent overdriving the IF amplifier
optionD,Maintain constant input level to the mixer
correctOption,A
explanation,"Remove amplitude variations from the received signal is correct because FM carries information in frequency, not amplitude. The limiter clips amplitude swings (noise, fading, AM interference) before the discriminator. Memory Trick: FM = frequency matters, so limiter &quot;throws away&quot; amplitude."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-007
,
question,"In an FM receiver, what is the purpose of the discriminator?"
optionA,Provide most of the receiver's selectivity
optionB,Recover the original modulation from the carrier
optionC,Select narrowband or wideband FM reception
optionD,Remove amplitude modulation from the received signal
correctOption,B
explanation,Recover the original modulation from the carrier is correct because the discriminator converts the frequency variations of the FM IF signal into the corresponding audio voltage. It is the FM detector. Memory Trick: Discriminator &quot;decides&quot; which frequency swing equals which audio voltage.
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-008
,
question,"In a receiver, which stage is controlled by the volume control?"
optionA,Discriminator
optionB,IF amplifier
optionC,AF amplifier
optionD,Limiter
correctOption,C
explanation,"AF amplifier is correct because the volume control usually adjusts the gain of the audio-frequency stages, changing how loud the recovered signal sounds in the speaker or headphones. RF and IF gains are normally not used for basic volume control. Memory Trick: Volume knob = audio stage gain."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-009
,
question,"In an FM receiver, which stage includes a squelch circuit?"
optionA,Limiter
optionB,IF amplifier
optionC,Product detector
optionD,AF amplifier
correctOption,D
explanation,"AF amplifier is correct because squelch generally mutes or un-mutes the audio path, often by controlling the audio amplifier stage. It keeps the speaker quiet when no usable signal is present. Memory Trick: Squelch = &quot;shut the speaker up&quot; unless a valid signal is heard."
BankQuestionID,B-003-003-010
,
question,"In a basic CW transmitter, the output from the oscillator is:"
optionA,at the transmitted signal's frequency
optionB,at the transmitted signal's power level
optionC,at a submultiple of the operating frequency
optionD,less stable than the transmitted signal
correctOption,A
explanation,"At the transmitted signal's frequency is correct because in a simple CW rig the crystal or VFO oscillator runs directly on the operating frequency, and later stages only amplify it. Multipliers or mixers are not used in the basic design. Memory Trick: In the simplest CW set, &quot;what the oscillator makes is what you transmit.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-004-001
,
question,"In a basic CW transmitter, what type of electricity directly powers each stage?"
optionA,Alternating current
optionB,Direct current
optionC,Radio frequency current
optionD,Audio frequency current
correctOption,B
explanation,"Direct current is correct because each stage is powered by DC from the power supply; RF and audio are signals riding on top of that DC, not the supply itself. Memory Trick: Think &quot;DC feeds the circuits, RF is just the signal they create.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-004-002
,
question,"In a basic CW transmitter, why is the oscillator followed by a driver/buffer stage?"
optionA,To filter out noise from the oscillator
optionB,To filter out spurious emissions from the oscillator
optionC,To prevent load changes from shifting the oscillator's frequency
optionD,To shape the oscillator waveform to prevent key clicks
correctOption,C
explanation,"To prevent load changes from shifting the oscillator's frequency is correct because the buffer or driver isolates the delicate oscillator from the varying load of later stages, keeping the frequency stable. Memory Trick: Buffer = &quot;shock absorber&quot; between oscillator and power stages."
BankQuestionID,B-003-004-003
,
question,"In a basic three-stage CW transmitter, what does the key do?"
optionA,It switches the oscillator on and off
optionB,It reduces key clicks
optionC,It reduces key chirps
optionD,It controls the amplitude of the carrier
correctOption,D
explanation,"It controls the amplitude of the carrier is correct because the key is usually placed in the keying line so that it turns RF output on and off, effectively controlling when carrier power is present. Other choices describe side effects that are handled by shaping networks, not the key itself. Memory Trick: Press key = RF amplitude present; release key = RF amplitude zero."
BankQuestionID,B-003-004-004
,
question,"In a basic CW transmitter, what does the power amplifier stage do?"
optionA,It increases the transmitter's output power
optionB,It removes CW chirps from the transmitted signal
optionC,It multiplies the oscillator frequency to the operating frequency
optionD,It reduces distortion in the transmitted signal
correctOption,A
explanation,It increases the transmitter's output power is correct because the PA takes the small RF signal from the driver or buffer and boosts it to the level needed to feed the antenna. Chirps and spurs are controlled elsewhere. Memory Trick: Power amplifier = &quot;muscle&quot; of the transmitter.
BankQuestionID,B-003-004-005
,
question,"In a basic CW transmitter, what does the key do?"
optionA,It makes and breaks the antenna connection
optionB,It switches the carrier on and off
optionC,It switches the carrier between two frequencies
optionD,It switches the transmitted tone on and off
correctOption,B
explanation,"It switches the carrier on and off is correct because in CW operation the key makes and breaks the RF path (or keying line), producing the dots and dashes of Morse as short bursts of RF energy. It does not switch between two frequencies. Memory Trick: CW = carrier on for a dot or dash, carrier off for the space."
BankQuestionID,B-003-004-006
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the antenna?"
optionA,Polarize signals received via sky-wave propagation
optionB,Separate signals from atmospheric noise
optionC,Convert electromagnetic waves into electrical currents
optionD,Protect the receiver from overload
correctOption,C
explanation,"Convert electromagnetic waves into electrical currents is correct because an antenna acts as a transducer, picking up radio waves and turning them into RF voltages and currents that the receiver can process. It does not &quot;filter out&quot; noise by itself. Memory Trick: Antenna = ear that turns waves in space into signals in a wire."
BankQuestionID,B-003-005-001
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the radio frequency (RF) amplifier?"
optionA,Provide sufficient drive for the automatic gain control circuit (AGC)
optionB,Increase the local oscillator signal to drive the mixer
optionC,Provide sufficient gain to activate the limiter circuit
optionD,Increase the sensitivity of the receiver
correctOption,D
explanation,"Increase the sensitivity of the receiver is correct because the RF amplifier boosts weak signals from the antenna before they reach the mixer, improving the receiver's ability to hear faint stations. The LO and limiter are handled elsewhere. Memory Trick: RF amp = &quot;first magnifying glass&quot; for weak signals."
BankQuestionID,B-003-005-002
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the mixer?"
optionA,Convert the received signal into the intermediate frequency
optionB,Convert the beat frequency oscillator signal to audio
optionC,Provide USB and LSB signals for sideband selection
optionD,Remove the carrier from the received signal
correctOption,A
explanation,"Convert the received signal into the intermediate frequency is correct because the mixer combines RF and local oscillator to produce sum and difference frequencies, with the difference chosen as the IF. Sideband selection happens later in filters or product detectors. Memory Trick: Mixer = &quot;frequency translator&quot; to the IF."
BankQuestionID,B-003-005-003
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the signal generated by the local oscillator?"
optionA,It is mixed with the intermediate frequency signal to produce a CW sidetone
optionB,It is mixed with the incoming signal to produce the intermediate frequency
optionC,It is mixed with the beat frequency oscillator signal to produce audio
optionD,It is fed to the receiver input to provide band edge markers
correctOption,B
explanation,It is mixed with the incoming signal to produce the intermediate frequency is correct because the LO is the reference frequency used in the mixer to shift the desired RF signal down to the IF. The BFO and sidetone are separate oscillators used later in the chain. Memory Trick: LO + RF → IF; that's the heart of the superhet.
BankQuestionID,B-003-005-004
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the intermediate frequency (IF) filter?"
optionA,Suppress spurious signals from the IF amplifier
optionB,"Reject RF from the product detector, passing only audio"
optionC,Provide most of the selectivity of the receiver
optionD,"For SSB reception, select the desired sideband"
correctOption,C
explanation,"Provide most of the selectivity of the receiver is correct because the IF filter is narrow and fixed in frequency, so it chooses which signals pass and which nearby signals are rejected. Memory Trick: Think &quot;channel chooser&quot; &mdash; the IF filter defines your receive channel."
BankQuestionID,B-003-005-005
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier?"
optionA,Boost the signal as required for the mixer
optionB,Increase the level of the recovered modulation
optionC,Provide sufficient gain to activate the limiter circuit
optionD,Provide most of the receiver gain
correctOption,D
explanation,"Provide most of the receiver gain is correct because most of the amplification happens at the fixed IF, where filters and stages are easiest to optimize. Memory Trick: RF amp &quot;opens the door,&quot; but the IF amp &quot;does the heavy lifting&quot; for gain."
BankQuestionID,B-003-005-006
,
question,"In an SSB/CW receiver, what is the purpose of the product detector?"
optionA,Recover the transmitted modulation

optionA,Shape the audio waveform
optionB,Remove harmonics from the transmitted signal
optionC,Remove the unwanted sideband
optionD,Suppress the RF carrier signal
correctOption,C
explanation,"Remove the unwanted sideband is correct because the balanced modulator produces a double-sideband suppressed-carrier signal, and the filter selects only one sideband. Memory Trick: Balanced modulator makes two sidebands, the filter chooses just one."
BankQuestionID,B-003-006-003
,
question,"In a typical single-sideband transmitter, at what frequency is the sideband filter tuned?"
optionA,At the VFO frequency
optionB,Near the operating frequency
optionC,At audio frequencies
optionD,Near the fixed RF oscillator frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"Near the fixed RF oscillator frequency is correct because the SSB filter works at the &quot;IF&quot; or carrier frequency produced by the fixed RF oscillator, not at the final transmitted RF frequency. Memory Trick: The SSB filter lives in the IF section, not at the VFO or audio."

,
question,"In a single-sideband transmitter, which stage normally includes a circuit providing protection from excessive SWR?"
optionA,Speech amplifier
optionB,Variable frequency oscillator
optionC,Balanced modulator

optionB,Translate the digital signal into alphanumeric characters
optionC,Modulate the received signal
optionD,Switch the transceiver between receive and transmit modes
correctOption,D

optionD,To match the impedance of the computer output signal to the impedance of the input of the computer
correctOption,B
explanation,"To prevent the coupling of the transceiver and computer from introducing hum and interference into the transmitted signals is correct because isolation transformers break ground loops and reduce noise. Memory Trick: Transformers &quot;pass the audio, block the hum.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-007-005
,
question,Why are some transceivers capable of operating computer-based digital modes without a separate sound card?
optionA,Because digital signal processing (DSP) is built-in
optionB,Because they support CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver)
optionC,Because they incorporate an audio codec
optionD,Because they provide a USB connector
correctOption,C
explanation,"Because they incorporate an audio codec is correct because the radio already performs the same audio A/D and D/A conversion that a separate sound card interface would provide, often via a built-in USB audio device. Memory Trick: Think &quot;radio with its own sound card&quot; &mdash; built-in codec means no extra box."

optionA,CW
optionB,SSB
optionC,AM
optionD,FM
correctOption,B

correctOption,B
explanation,"2.4 kHz is correct because SSB voice typically needs about 2 to 3 kHz of bandwidth, while 250 Hz and 500 Hz are CW/data widths and 6 kHz is more suitable for AM. Memory Trick: &quot;SSB voice likes about 2.4 kHz of space.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-010-009
,
question,"A communications receiver has four filters installed in it, respectively designated as 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 2.4 kHz and 6 kHz. You are copying a CW transmission and there is a great deal of interference. Which one of the filters would you choose?"
optionA,2.4 kHz
optionB,6 kHz
optionC,250 Hz
optionD,500 Hz
correctOption,C
explanation,"250 Hz is correct because CW is a very narrow signal and the narrowest filter will cut out the most adjacent interference while still passing your CW tone. Memory Trick: For CW in heavy QRM, think &quot;go narrow or go nowhere&quot; &mdash; choose the smallest bandwidth."
BankQuestionID,B-003-010-010

optionC,A slow change in transmitter frequency as the oscillator warms up
optionD,An overload in a receiver's audio circuit whenever CW is received
correctOption,A
explanation,"A small change in the output frequency of a transmitter each time a dit or dah is sent is correct because chirp is that sliding or warbling of frequency at each keying, heard as a &quot;cheep&quot; instead of a pure tone. Memory Trick: Think of a bird &quot;chirping&quot; up or down in pitch with every element."

,
question,Morse code is usually transmitted by radio as:
optionA,a phase-shifted carrier
optionB,an interrupted carrier
optionC,a series of key clicks
optionD,a continuous carrier
correctOption,B
explanation,"an interrupted carrier is correct because CW keying simply turns the carrier on and off to form dots and dashes. Memory Trick: CW = &quot;carrier on, carrier off&quot; like a flashlight blinking in RF."

,
question,You are transmitting using amplitude modulation. What bandwidth does your signal occupy if the highest frequency of your voice is 3 kHz?
optionA,12 kHz
optionB,9 kHz
optionC,6 kHz
optionD,3 kHz
correctOption,C
explanation,"6 kHz is correct because AM generates two sidebands, one above and one below the carrier, each extending to the highest audio frequency: total RF bandwidth = 2 &times; 3 kHz. Memory Trick: For AM, think &quot;two for one&quot; &mdash; double the highest audio frequency."
BankQuestionID,B-003-011-007
,
question,What frequency components are present in the bandwidth of an amplitude modulated signal?
optionA,Two sidebands
optionB,One sideband
optionC,Carrier and one sideband
optionD,Carrier and two sidebands

optionA,drift in frequency over time
optionB,become overmodulated
optionC,generate key clicks
optionD,cause undue distortion
correctOption,A
explanation,"drift in frequency over time is correct because instability causes the signal to wander in frequency, making reception difficult and annoying other operators. Memory Trick: A &quot;wobbly&quot; oscillator makes a &quot;wandering&quot; signal &mdash; stability prevents drift."

optionA,It may cause harmonic interference on higher bands
optionB,It may cause interference to other stations operating on lower bands
optionC,It may cause digital interference to computer equipment
optionD,It may interfere with other stations operating near its frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"It may interfere with other stations operating near its frequency is correct because excessive mic gain overdrives the stages and creates splatter, spreading your signal wider than normal. Memory Trick: &quot;Mic gain too hot&quot; makes your signal &quot;spatter the lot.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-001
,
question,What may happen if an SSB transmitter is operated with too much speech processing?
optionA,It may cause audio distortion or splatter interference to other stations operating near its frequency
optionB,It may cause digital interference to computer equipment
optionC,It may cause insufficient modulation of the carrier
optionD,It may cause interference to other stations operating on a higher frequency band
correctOption,A
explanation,"It may cause audio distortion or splatter interference to other stations operating near its frequency is correct because overdone processing flattens peaks, adds distortion, and widens your occupied bandwidth. Memory Trick: &quot;Cranked&quot; processor = &quot;crunched&quot; audio and splatter."
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-002
,
question,"What is the term for the average power during one RF cycle, at the crest of the modulation envelope?"
optionA,Peak transmitter input power
optionB,Peak envelope power
optionC,RMS power
optionD,Average radio frequency power
correctOption,B
explanation,Peak envelope power is correct because PEP refers to the RF power averaged over one RF cycle at the highest point of the modulation envelope. Memory Trick: Think PEP = &quot;Power at the Envelope Peak.&quot;
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-003
,
question,What is the usual bandwidth of an amateur radio single-sideband signal?
optionA,2 kHz
optionB,Between 3 kHz and 6 kHz
optionC,Between 2 kHz and 3 kHz
optionD,1 kHz
correctOption,C
explanation,Between 2 kHz and 3 kHz is correct because typical SSB voice signals use about 2.4&ndash;2.8 kHz of bandwidth for intelligible audio without wasting spectrum. Memory Trick: Remember SSB voice as &quot;about 2 and a bit kHz&quot; wide.
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-004
,
question,Why does the power amplifier of the SSB transmitter need to be linear?
optionA,Hum and noise are reduced
optionB,Power demand on the power supply is regulated
optionC,Power output variations due to voice peaks are reduced
optionD,Voice is unintelligible when amplified by a non-linear amplifier
correctOption,D
explanation,"Voice is unintelligible when amplified by a non-linear amplifier is correct because non-linearity distorts the complex SSB waveform, creating splatter and making speech hard to understand. Memory Trick: SSB &quot;shape&quot; must be preserved, so the amplifier must be linear."
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-005
,
question,What is one advantage of carrier suppression in a double sideband voice transmission?
optionA,More of the output power can be put into the sidebands
optionB,Only half the bandwidth is needed for the same information content
optionC,Greater modulation percentage is obtainable with lower distortion
optionD,Simpler equipment can be used to receive a double sideband suppressed carrier signal
correctOption,A
explanation,"More of the output power can be put into the sidebands is correct because the carrier carries no information; by suppressing it, more of your transmitter power goes into the sidebands that actually convey the audio. Memory Trick: &quot;Kill the carrier, feed the sidebands.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-006
,
question,What does overmodulation do to a single-sideband signal?
optionA,It has higher fidelity and an improved signal-to-noise ratio
optionB,It becomes distorted and occupies more bandwidth
optionC,It increases the range of your signal
optionD,It occupies less bandwidth and has a poor high frequency response
correctOption,B
explanation,"It becomes distorted and occupies more bandwidth is correct because driving an SSB transmitter too hard creates splatter and extra unwanted side components, spreading into adjacent channels. Memory Trick: Overmodulate and your signal &quot;bulges&quot; into your neighbors."
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-007
,
question,How should the microphone gain control be adjusted for voice operation on a single-sideband transmitter?
optionA,For 100% frequency deviation on voice peaks
optionB,For a dip in the drain or collector current
optionC,Such that the maximum range on the ALC meter is never exceeded on voice peaks
optionD,For full deflection of the ALC meter
correctOption,C
explanation,"Such that the maximum range on the ALC meter is never exceeded on voice peaks is correct because ALC protects the transmitter from overdrive and distortion. You want the ALC to just move on peaks, but not slam to the end of the scale. Memory Trick: Think of ALC as a ceiling &mdash; touch it on voice peaks, never punch through it."
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-008
,
question,The purpose of a balanced modulator in an SSB transmitter is to:
optionA,make sure that the carrier and both sidebands are 180 degrees out of phase
optionB,ensure that the percentage of modulation is kept constant
optionC,suppress the carrier and pass one sideband
optionD,suppress the carrier and pass the two sidebands
correctOption,D
explanation,"suppress the carrier and pass the two sidebands is correct because a balanced modulator cancels the carrier, leaving only the upper and lower sidebands. A later filter removes one of those sidebands to create SSB. Memory Trick: Balanced modulator = &quot;balanced out&quot; carrier, sidebands remain."
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-009
,
question,"Your SSB transmitter is set to operate lower sideband at 7100 kHz. With a single 1000 Hz tone as modulation, at which frequency is RF transmitted?"
optionA,7099 kHz
optionB,7101 kHz
optionC,6100 kHz
optionD,8100 kHz
correctOption,A
explanation,"7099 kHz is correct because lower sideband components appear below the carrier by the audio frequency. A 1 kHz tone on LSB at 7100 kHz produces RF 1 kHz lower, at 7099 kHz. Memory Trick: LSB = &quot;Lower than carrier by audio.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-010
,
question,The automatic level control (ALC) in an SSB transmitter:
optionA,reduces system noise
optionB,limits the input audio peaks so that the transmitter is not overdriven
optionC,reduces transmitter audio feedback
optionD,increases the occupied bandwidth
correctOption,B
explanation,"limits the input audio peaks so that the transmitter is not overdriven is correct because ALC samples the RF output and reduces gain when peaks get too high, preventing distortion and splatter. Memory Trick: ALC = &quot;Automatic Level Control&quot; &mdash; it automatically pulls back the reins on your signal."
BankQuestionID,B-003-012-011
,
question,What causes the loud noise heard from an FM receiver in the absence of a signal?
optionA,The nature of atmospheric noise in the VHF range
optionB,The higher intermediate frequency used in FM receivers
optionC,The very large gain of stages ahead of the discriminator
optionD,The additional gain following the discriminator
correctOption,C
explanation,"The very large gain of stages ahead of the discriminator is correct because wideband IF stages with lots of gain amplify internal and external noise when no carrier is present, producing loud hiss. Memory Trick: No signal + big gain = big hiss."
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-001
,
question,"You are using an FM repeater configured for 5 kHz deviation, but your transmitter is set to 2.5 kHz deviation. What is the consequence?"
optionA,Your audio will be distorted
optionB,Your range will be shorter
optionC,The repeater will not respond
optionD,Your audio will be low
correctOption,D
explanation,"Your audio will be low is correct because with only half the expected deviation, the receiver slices out a narrower portion of frequency swing, so your voice sounds quiet and thin. Memory Trick: Too little deviation = &quot;whisper&quot; audio."
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-002
,
question,What term defines the change in frequency caused by modulation in an FM transmitter?
optionA,Deviation
optionB,Spectrum spread
optionC,Shift
optionD,Modulation index
correctOption,A
explanation,Deviation is correct because it is the name for how far the FM carrier moves above and below its center frequency with modulation. Memory Trick: FM &quot;deviates&quot; from the center &mdash; that change is the deviation.
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-003
,
question,What kind of emission would your FM transmitter produce if its microphone failed to work?
optionA,A phase-modulated carrier
optionB,An unmodulated carrier
optionC,A frequency-modulated carrier
optionD,An amplitude-modulated carrier
correctOption,B
explanation,"An unmodulated carrier is correct because without audio, the FM modulator does not vary the frequency, so the transmitter simply emits a steady carrier. Memory Trick: No audio in = no deviation out."
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-004
,
question,Why is FM voice best for local VHF/UHF radio communications?
optionA,It is more resistant to distortion caused by reflected signals
optionB,Its RF carrier stays on frequency better than the AM modes
optionC,It provides a good signal-to-noise ratio at low RF signal levels
optionD,The carrier is not detectable
correctOption,C
explanation,"It provides a good signal-to-noise ratio at low RF signal levels is correct because FM has a noise threshold and capture effect that keep audio clean until the signal drops very low. Memory Trick: For local work, FM often sounds &quot;clean or gone,&quot; which is great for readability."
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-005
,
question,What is the approximate bandwidth of a frequency modulated signal using 5 kHz deviation?
optionA,Less than 5 kHz
optionB,Between 5 kHz and 10 kHz
optionC,Greater than 20 kHz
optionD,Between 10 kHz and 20 kHz
correctOption,D
explanation,"Between 10 kHz and 20 kHz is correct because, by Carson&apos;s rule, FM bandwidth is roughly twice the deviation plus a bit for the highest audio frequency, which for typical narrowband FM falls in that 10&ndash;20 kHz range. Memory Trick: 5 kHz deviation &rarr; think &quot;roughly double and then some.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-006
,
question,How is a higher level of the modulating signal represented in an FM signal?
optionA,By a larger deviation of the carrier frequency
optionB,By a larger amplitude of the carrier
optionC,By a larger pulse width in the transmitted wave train
optionD,By a larger peak envelope power
correctOption,A
explanation,"By a larger deviation of the carrier frequency is correct because, in FM, louder audio does not change the amplitude, it changes how far the carrier swings in frequency. Memory Trick: FM = Frequency Moves; louder voice = bigger moves."
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-007
,
question,What modulation method is most closely related to frequency modulation?
optionA,Pulse modulation
optionB,Phase modulation
optionC,Multiplex modulation
optionD,Amplitude modulation
correctOption,B
explanation,Phase modulation is correct because FM and PM are mathematically related; each can be generated from the other with appropriate pre-emphasis of the audio. Memory Trick: Think of FM and PM as &quot;cousins&quot; in the angle modulation family.
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-008
,
question,Why is&apos;t FM used as an amateur radio emission mode below 28 MHz?
optionA,Harmonics could not be attenuated to practical levels
optionB,The frequency stability would not be adequate
optionC,The bandwidth would exceed limits in the regulations
optionD,The transmitter efficiency for this mode is low
correctOption,C
explanation,The bandwidth would exceed limits in the regulations is correct because FM with several kilohertz of deviation needs much more bandwidth than narrow HF allocations allow. Memory Trick: Big FM swing + narrow HF bands = not compatible by rule.
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-009
,
question,"Several stations report that your FM transmission is loud and distorted, but on frequency. Which of the following is the most probable cause of the distortion?"
optionA,Setting the wrong CTCSS tone
optionB,Excessive transmit power
optionC,Cross-polarized antenna
optionD,Speaking too loudly into the microphone
correctOption,D
explanation,"Speaking too loudly into the microphone is correct because overdriving the mic input causes excessive deviation and audio distortion, even though the RF carrier is exactly on frequency. Memory Trick: If others say &quot;too loud and crunchy,&quot; first suspect your mic level."
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-010
,
question,"When more than one signal is present, the FM receiver is likely to demodulate only the strongest signal. What is this behaviour called?"
optionA,Capture effect
optionB,Overpower effect
optionC,Interference effect
optionD,Surrender effect
correctOption,A
explanation,Capture effect is correct because an FM receiver tends to &quot;capture&quot; the stronger of two signals on nearly the same frequency and suppress the weaker one. Memory Trick: Strongest signal &quot;captures&quot; the receiver.
BankQuestionID,B-003-013-011
,
question,What do many amateur radio operators use to help form good Morse code characters?
optionA,DTMF keypad
optionB,Electronic keyer
optionC,Straight key
optionD,Touchpad
correctOption,B
explanation,"Electronic keyer is correct because a keyer automatically times dits and dahs and provides consistent spacing, helping the operator send clean, readable code. Memory Trick: Let the keyer handle the timing so you can focus on the message."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-001
,
question,How does an electronic keyer help form good Morse code characters?
optionA,By improving the tone of the CW signal
optionB,By ensuring that the dots and dashes have the same amplitude
optionC,By regulating the lengths of the dits and dahs
optionD,By eliminating key clicks
correctOption,C
explanation,"By regulating the lengths of the dits and dahs is correct because the keyer generates elements of fixed, proper duration based on the speed setting. Memory Trick: You tap once, the keyer &quot;draws&quot; a perfect dit or dah for you."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-002
,
question,What do you need to adjust before using a microphone for the first time with a transceiver?
optionA,Noise blanker threshold
optionB,Deviation control
optionC,Automatic gain control level
optionD,Microphone gain level
correctOption,D
explanation,"Microphone gain level is correct because each microphone and voice is different, so you must set mic gain so that ALC and modulation are correct without distortion. Memory Trick: New mic, new voice &mdash; always set the gain first."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-003
,
question,What noise management system analyzes noise and signal characteristics to partially remove noise?
optionA,DSP noise reduction
optionB,Noise canceller (phasing)
optionC,Noise limiter
optionD,Noise blanker
correctOption,A
explanation,DSP noise reduction is correct because digital signal processing can distinguish noise from desired audio and reduce the noise component while leaving speech more intact. Memory Trick: Think of DSP as &quot;smart filtering&quot; that learns what to turn down.
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-004
,
question,What circuit causes a transmitter to automatically transmit when an operator speaks into its microphone?
optionA,VFO
optionB,VOX
optionC,VXO
optionD,VCO
correctOption,B
explanation,"VOX is correct because VOX (Voice Operated Transmit) senses your voice audio and keys the transmitter automatically. The other circuits are oscillators used for frequency control, not for voice-operated keying. Memory Trick: VOX = &quot;Voice Operated Xmit&quot; &mdash; voice makes it transmit."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-005
,
question,What is the reason for using a properly adjusted speech processor with a single-sideband voice transmitter?
optionA,It reduces unwanted noise pickup from the microphone
optionB,It improves voice frequency fidelity
optionC,It improves the intelligibility of your signal
optionD,It reduces average transmitter power requirements
correctOption,C
explanation,"It improves the intelligibility of your signal is correct because a speech processor compresses the audio peaks, raising average talk power so your signal punches through noise and QSB better. The other options either misunderstand what a processor does or describe side effects, not the main benefit. Memory Trick: Think &quot;processor = punch&quot; &mdash; clearer copy at the other end."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-006
,
question,"If a single-sideband voice transmitter is 100% modulated, how will using a speech processor affect the transmitter&apos;s output?"
optionA,Increase the peak envelope power
optionB,Decrease the average power
optionC,Decrease the peak envelope power
optionD,Increase the average power
correctOption,D
explanation,"Increase the average power is correct because compression squeezes loud peaks and lifts the softer parts, so the peaks stay about the same while the average power goes up. Memory Trick: Speech processor &quot;fills in the valleys&quot; &mdash; average climbs while peaks stay put."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-007
,
question,"In a receiver, what noise management circuit recognizes high-amplitude short-duration pulses and removes them?"
optionA,Noise blanker
optionB,Noise limiter
optionC,Automatic level control
optionD,Narrowband filter
correctOption,A
explanation,"Noise blanker is correct because a blanker detects sharp pulse noise (like ignition clicks) and briefly mutes or clips the signal during each pulse. The other circuits reduce overall level or bandwidth, but do not specifically target pulses. Memory Trick: Blanker = &quot;blank out the bangs.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-008
,
question,What type of interference is a noise blanker circuit most effective in eliminating?
optionA,Distortion from overdeviated signals
optionB,Short-duration impulse-type noise
optionC,Continuous wideband background noise
optionD,Interfering signals on the same frequency
correctOption,B
explanation,"Short-duration impulse-type noise is correct because blankers are designed for things like spark plug or power-line crackle. They do not cure steady hiss, other stations on-frequency, or distortion. Memory Trick: Think &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;click&quot; noise &mdash; that&apos;s the blanker&apos;s job."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-009
,
question,What is the function of transmit/receive switching in a transceiver?
optionA,To prevent RF currents entering the transmitter circuits
optionB,To allow more than one transmitter to be used
optionC,To enable one antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving
optionD,To change antennas for operation on other frequencies
correctOption,C
explanation,"To enable one antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving is correct because the T/R switch quickly connects the antenna to the transmitter when you key up, and back to the receiver when you unkey. Memory Trick: One antenna, two jobs &mdash; T/R does the switching."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-010
,
question,What type of microphone has internal components similar to a loudspeaker?
optionA,Crystal
optionB,Condenser
optionC,Electret
optionD,Dynamic
correctOption,D
explanation,"Dynamic is correct because a dynamic mic uses a moving coil in a magnetic field, just like a loudspeaker in reverse. The others use crystals or capacitors instead of a voice-coil. Memory Trick: Speaker and dynamic mic are &quot;mirror images&quot; of each other."
BankQuestionID,B-003-014-011
,
question,"Why can a modern digital radio system transmit voice and images, not just data?"
optionA,Any analog information can be converted to digital data
optionB,Digital protocols can fall back to analog as needed
optionC,Digital signals are continuously variable signals
optionD,Modern transceivers have the necessary high efficiency amplifiers
correctOption,A
explanation,"Any analog information can be converted to digital data is correct because sound, pictures, and sensor readings can all be sampled and encoded as numbers. Once it is bits, the radio only sees digital data. Memory Trick: If it can be sampled, it can be sent as digital."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-001
,
question,What is the fundamental difference between digital and analog data?
optionA,Digital data requires complex waveforms for transmission
optionB,Digital data is encoded as discrete pre-agreed values
optionC,Digital data represents information as a continuously variable quantity
optionD,Digital data easily translates into digital signals
correctOption,B
explanation,"Digital data is encoded as discrete pre-agreed values is correct because digital uses specific symbols (like 0 and 1), while analog can smoothly vary over a range. Memory Trick: Analog = &quot;any value&quot;; digital = &quot;pick from the list.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-002
,
question,What is the function of a digipeater?
optionA,"To receive analog FM, convert to digital data and retransmit"
optionB,"To receive digital data, convert to analog FM and retransmit"
optionC,To receive digital data and retransmit data marked for retransmission
optionD,To receive digital data and export to the internet
correctOption,C
explanation,"To receive digital data and retransmit data marked for retransmission is correct because a digipeater repeats only packets addressed or &quot;via&quot; that station, extending range of those specific frames. Memory Trick: Digi + repeater = &quot;digital repeater&quot; for selected packets."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-003
,
question,What does &quot;network&quot; mean in packet radio?
optionA,A way of connecting terminal-node controllers by telephone so data can be sent over long distances
optionB,The connections on terminal-node controllers
optionC,The programming in a terminal-node controller that rejects other callers if a station is already connected
optionD,A way of connecting packet-radio stations so data can be sent over long distances
correctOption,D
explanation,A way of connecting packet-radio stations so data can be sent over long distances is correct because multiple nodes and digipeaters link together to forward traffic beyond direct range. Memory Trick: Think &quot;many packet nodes linked&quot; when you hear network.
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-004
,
question,Why can dozens of FT8 communications occur simultaneously in the space needed for one single-sideband transmission?
optionA,Narrow bandwidth of an FT8 signal
optionB,Time interleaving of the transmissions
optionC,Formatting of the messages into packets
optionD,Message structure with limited contact information
correctOption,A
explanation,"Narrow bandwidth of an FT8 signal is correct because each FT8 signal is only a few tens of hertz wide, so many can fit side by side in a 2.5 to 3 kHz SSB passband. Memory Trick: FT8 = &quot;tiny slices&quot; of spectrum."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-005
,
question,Which of these modes can work at the lowest signal-to-noise ratio as measured in a 2500 Hz bandwidth?
optionA,CW
optionB,FT8
optionC,PSK31
optionD,RTTY
correctOption,B
explanation,"FT8 is correct because it is designed to decode signals many dB below the noise floor, lower than typical PSK31, RTTY or casual CW operation. Memory Trick: When signals are &quot;down in the mud,&quot; think FT8."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-006
,
question,"When selecting an RTTY transmitting frequency, what minimum frequency separation from a contact in progress should you allow (centre to centre) to minimize interference?"
optionA,3 kHz to 5 kHz
optionB,6 kHz to 10 kHz
optionC,250 Hz to 500 Hz
optionD,50 Hz to 100 Hz
correctOption,C
explanation,"250 Hz to 500 Hz is correct because RTTY signals are a few hundred hertz wide, so this spacing keeps your signal from overlapping a nearby QSO. Memory Trick: For narrow digital modes, think &quot;a few hundred hertz apart&quot; to play nice."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-007
,
question,"When using a digital mode based on a computer sound card, how can you verify that the transmit audio level is NOT excessive?"
optionA,Ensure your transmitter&apos;s audio compression is set to maximum
optionB,Verify that the automatic level control (ALC) is actively limiting every transmission
optionC,Ask a local station to confirm your signal can be successfully decoded
optionD,Ask a local station to confirm your signal is free of splatter
correctOption,D
explanation,"Ask a local station to confirm your signal is free of splatter is correct because overdriving the audio makes your signal wide and messy, which another station will clearly hear, even if decoding still works. Memory Trick: &quot;How do I sound?&quot; reports are the best overdrive detector."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-008
,
question,What feature of packet radio makes it especially useful for emergency communications?
optionA,Reliable messaging (guaranteed delivery or notification of failure)
optionB,Packet functionality is included in most modern radios
optionC,"Capable of simultaneous voice, image and data transmission"
optionD,Encrypted signals prevent eavesdropping
correctOption,A
explanation,Reliable messaging (guaranteed delivery or notification of failure) is correct because packet protocols use acknowledgements and retries so you know whether a message arrived intact. Memory Trick: Packet = &quot;did it get there? yes or no&quot; &mdash; very valuable in emergencies.
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-009
,
question,A digital protocol implements automatic repeat request (ARQ). What does it permit?
optionA,Automatic link establishment
optionB,Error correction
optionC,Unattended operation
optionD,Error detection
correctOption,B
explanation,"Error correction is correct because ARQ asks the sender to retransmit when errors are detected, effectively correcting the data by replacing bad packets with good ones. Memory Trick: ARQ = &quot;Ask to Repeat Quickly&quot; when bits get scrambled."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-010
,
question,"With a digital communication mode based on a computer sound card, what is the result of feeding excessive audio into the transmitter?"
optionA,Lower error rate
optionB,Power amplifier overheating
optionC,Splatter or out-of-channel emissions
optionD,Higher signal-to-noise ratio
correctOption,C
explanation,"Splatter or out-of-channel emissions is correct because overdriving the audio chain overmodulates the signal, creating distortion products that spread into adjacent frequencies. Memory Trick: Too much audio = &quot;paint outside the lines&quot; in the band."
BankQuestionID,B-003-015-011
,
question,What approximate voltage does a standard automobile starter battery usually supply?
optionA,16 volts
optionB,28 volts
optionC,9 volts
optionD,12 volts
correctOption,D
explanation,"12 volts is correct because typical car &quot;12 V&quot; systems run from about 12.0 V at rest to around 14 V while charging, but are nominally rated as 12 V. Memory Trick: Think of all &quot;12 volt&quot; mobile rigs &mdash; they are designed to run from a car battery."
BankQuestionID,B-003-016-001
,
question,Which of the following has a positive terminal and a negative terminal?
optionA,A battery
optionB,A potentiometer
optionC,A fuse
optionD,A resistor
correctOption,A
explanation,A battery is correct because it has clearly marked positive and negative terminals that define the direction of conventional current flow. The other components are not polarized in that way for basic DC use. Memory Trick: Think of a battery as having a &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; sign like on a math line.
BankQuestionID,B-003-016-002
,
question,"A battery, that can be repeatedly recharged by supplying it with electrical energy, is known as a:"
optionA,primary battery
optionB,storage battery
optionC,low leakage battery
optionD,memory battery
correctOption,B
explanation,"Storage battery is correct because it refers to a rechargeable secondary cell, unlike a primary battery which is meant to be used once and discarded. Memory Trick: &quot;Store and restore&quot; &mdash; a storage battery can be restored (recharged)."
BankQuestionID,B-003-016-003
,
question,Which of the following is a source of electromotive force (EMF)?
optionA,P-channel FET
optionB,Metal-film resistor
optionC,Lithium-ion battery
optionD,Germanium diode
correctOption,C
explanation,"Lithium-ion battery is correct because a battery is an active source of EMF, able to supply voltage and current. The other devices are passive or controlled components that require an external source. Memory Trick: If it can power a circuit by itself, it is a source of EMF."
BankQuestionID,B-003-016-004
,
question,Why is the NiMH battery often preferred over a conventional alkaline battery?
optionA,It provides a higher voltage
optionB,It can be discarded without precautions
optionC,It contains a liquid electrolyte
optionD,It can be repeatedly recharged
correctOption,D
explanation,"It can be repeatedly recharged is correct because NiMH cells are rechargeable secondary cells, whereas alkaline cells are generally single-use. Memory Trick: &quot;NiMH&quot; &mdash; think &quot;New charge, Many Hours&quot; to remember it is rechargeable."
BankQuestionID,B-003-016-005
,
question,The voltage at a battery's terminals will drop when it supplies current. What is the cause of the drop?
optionA,Internal resistance
optionB,Electrolyte becoming dry
optionC,Current capacity
optionD,Voltage capacity
correctOption,A
explanation,"Internal resistance is correct because the battery behaves like an ideal voltage source in series with a small internal resistor, so Vdrop = I &times; Rinternal when current flows. Memory Trick: More current means more &quot;sag&quot; because of that hidden resistor inside."

optionA,High tolerance to overcharge
optionB,High battery capacity per kilogram
optionC,Simple charging methods
optionD,Lower voltage per cell
correctOption,B
explanation,"High battery capacity per kilogram is correct because lithium-based batteries have much higher energy density than lead-acid batteries, making them lighter for the same capacity. Memory Trick: Think &quot;lithium = light&quot; for light weight and high capacity."
BankQuestionID,B-003-016-007
,
question,Battery capacity is commonly stated as a value of current delivered over a specified period of time. What is the effect of exceeding that specified current?
optionA,The battery will accept the subsequent charge in a shorter time
optionB,The voltage delivered will be higher
optionC,The battery will discharge more rapidly than specified
optionD,One or more cells may become short-circuited
correctOption,C
explanation,The battery will discharge more rapidly than specified is correct because drawing more current than the rated value empties the stored charge in less time and can reduce the effective capacity. Memory Trick: Think of current like &quot;drinking faster from the tank&quot; &mdash; it empties sooner.

,
question,"What voltage and capacity will you achieve by connecting two 12 volts, 20 ampere-hour batteries in parallel?"
optionA,"6 volts, 80 ampere-hours"
optionB,"24 volts, 20 ampere-hours"
optionC,"24 volts, 40 ampere-hours"
optionD,"12 volts, 40 ampere-hours"
correctOption,D
explanation,"12 volts, 40 ampere-hours is correct because parallel connection keeps the voltage the same and adds the capacities: Vsame, Ahsum. So 12 V stays 12 V, and 20 Ah + 20 Ah = 40 Ah. Memory Trick: Parallel = &quot;side by side tanks&quot; with the same height (voltage) but more volume (Ah)."

optionA,Harmonics
optionB,Overmodulation
optionC,Chirp
optionD,Key clicks
correctOption,C
explanation,"Chirp is correct because a poorly regulated supply lets the voltage change each time you key the transmitter, slightly shifting the oscillator frequency and causing a &quot;chirp&quot; at the start of each element. Memory Trick: Think &quot;voltage wobble = frequency wobble = chirp.&quot;"
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-001
,
question,What device converts 120 volts AC to 12 volts DC?
optionA,Low-pass filter
optionB,Inverter
optionC,Power conditioner
optionD,Power supply
correctOption,D
explanation,"Power supply is correct because a DC power supply (often called a &quot;12 V supply&quot;) rectifies and regulates mains AC into low-voltage DC. An inverter does the opposite, creating AC from DC. Memory Trick: &quot;Supply&quot; supplies DC to your rig."
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-002

BankQuestionID,B-003-017-005
,
question,"Apart from efficiency, what is one advantage of a switching (switch mode) power supply over a linear power supply?"
optionA,Lower risk of radio frequency noise
optionB,Different simultaneous output voltages
optionC,Simpler to repair
optionD,Reduced physical dimensions and weight
correctOption,D
explanation,"Reduced physical dimensions and weight is correct because switching supplies use high-frequency transformers, which can be much smaller and lighter than the large iron cores used in linear supplies. Memory Trick: &quot;Switchers are slim&quot; compared to heavy linears."
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-006
,
question,Why are heavy-gauge wires used for a 100-watt transceiver's DC power connection?
optionA,To minimize the voltage drop
optionB,To prevent an electrical shock
optionC,To avoid RF interference
optionD,To minimize ripple
correctOption,A
explanation,"To minimize the voltage drop is correct because thick wire has lower resistance, so Vdrop = I &times; R is smaller at the high currents drawn by a 100 W rig. Memory Trick: More amps = fatter wire to keep the volts up at the radio."
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-007
,
question,What are the nominal power-line voltages supplied to homes?
optionA,130 volts and 260 volts
optionB,120 volts and 240 volts
optionC,110 volts and 220 volts
optionD,100 volts and 200 volts
correctOption,B
explanation,120 volts and 240 volts is correct because typical North American residential service provides 120 V for standard outlets and 240 V for large appliances. Memory Trick: Think of common labels: &quot;120 V outlet&quot; and &quot;240 V dryer/stove&quot;.
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-008
,
question,"Your transceiver's user guide suggests limiting the voltage drop to 0.5 volts and the vehicle battery is 3 metres away. Given the losses listed below at the required current of 22 amperes, which minimum wire gauge must you use?"
optionA,"Number 12, 0.11 V per metre"
optionB,"Number 8, 0.05 V per metre"
optionC,"Number 10, 0.07 V per metre"
optionD,"Number 14, 0.19 V per metre"
correctOption,C
explanation,"Number 10, 0.07 V per metre is correct because the round-trip length is 6 metres (there and back). The voltage drop would be 6 &times; 0.07 = 0.42 V, within the 0.5 V limit. Number 12 and 14 would drop too much, and number 8, while acceptable, is larger than necessary. Memory Trick: Remember to count &quot;there and back&quot; (double the distance) when calculating voltage drop."
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-009
,
question,Why must the positive lead from the vehicle battery to your transceiver be fused?
optionA,To prevent interference to the vehicle's electronic systems
optionB,To reduce the voltage drop in the radio's DC supply
optionC,To protect the radio from transient voltages
optionD,To prevent an overcurrent situation from starting a fire
correctOption,D
explanation,"To prevent an overcurrent situation from starting a fire is correct because if the cable shorts, the car battery can supply very high current; the fuse opens the circuit before the wire or components overheat. Memory Trick: Think of the fuse as a &quot;burn before the car does&quot; safety link."
BankQuestionID,B-003-017-010
,
question,You have a very loud low-frequency hum appearing on your transmission. In what part of the transmitter would you first look for the trouble?
optionA,The power supply
optionB,The variable-frequency oscillator
optionC,The driver circuit
optionD,The power amplifier circuit
correctOption,A
explanation,The power supply is correct because low-frequency hum is usually caused by poor filtering or a fault in the power supply (often 50/60 Hz and its harmonics). The other stages generally do not create this kind of steady low-frequency hum on their own. Memory Trick: Hear a deep &quot;mains&quot; hum? Think &quot;check the supply first.&quot;

,
question,"What electrical hazard, if any, does the starter battery in a vehicle present?"
optionA,"None, given its low voltage"
optionB,High electromagnetic fields
optionC,Possibility of electric shock
optionD,High short-circuit current
correctOption,D
explanation,"High short-circuit current is correct because a vehicle starter battery can deliver very large currents, enough to melt metal and start fires if shorted, even though the voltage is low. Memory Trick: Car batteries may be &quot;only 12 V&quot; but they are &quot;hundreds of amps&quot; dangerous."
BankQuestionID,B-003-018-003
,

question,"If you were to cut a half-wave dipole for 3.75 MHz, what would be its approximate length?"
optionA,62.40 metres
optionB,80.00 metres
optionC,38.13 metres
optionD,40.00 metres
correctOption,C
explanation,"38.13 metres is correct because using the dipole formula 143 divided by 3.75 MHz gives about 38 metres total length. Memory Trick: ""Dipole length in metres: 143 / f (MHz)."""

,
question,What is a quad antenna?
optionA,A centre-fed half-wavelength long wire
optionB,A quarter-wavelength vertical conductor fed at the bottom
optionC,"Four straight, parallel elements in line with each other, each approximately a half-wavelength long"
optionD,"Two or more parallel four-sided wire loops, each approximately one wavelength long"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Two or more parallel four-sided wire loops, each approximately one wavelength long is correct because a quad uses square (or nearly square) loops instead of straight elements like a Yagi. Memory Trick: ""Quad = square loop elements, usually in pairs or more."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-001
,
question,What is a delta loop antenna with parasitic elements?
optionA,"An antenna consisting of multiple elements, each a triangular loop whose total length is approximately one wavelength"
optionB,An antenna made of a large multi-turn triangular loop
optionC,"An antenna system made of three vertical antennas, arranged in a triangular shape"
optionD,An antenna made from several triangular coils of wire on an insulating form
correctOption,A
explanation,"An antenna consisting of multiple elements, each a triangular loop whose total length is approximately one wavelength is correct because a delta loop is a full-wave triangular loop, and adding additional, un-driven loops creates parasitic elements similar to a quad or Yagi. The other options describe shapes or constructions that are not how delta loop arrays are actually built. Memory Trick: Think ""delta = triangle, loop = 1 wavelength, extras = parasitic elements."""

question,What is the approximate length of the driven element of a quad antenna designed for 21.4 MHz?
optionA,3.57 metres
optionB,14.30 metres
optionC,7.01 metres
optionD,10.93 metres
correctOption,B
explanation,"14.30 metres is correct because a quad driven element is about one full wavelength long, and 300 divided by 21.4 MHz is close to 14 metres, matching the given value. The other options are too short or too long to be a full-wave loop at this frequency. Memory Trick: For quad loops, remember ""about 300 divided by frequency in MHz"" for the total loop length."
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-003
,
question,What is the approximate length of the driven element of a quad antenna designed for 14.3 MHz?
optionA,16.36 metres
optionB,5.35 metres
optionC,21.40 metres
optionD,10.49 metres
correctOption,C
explanation,"21.40 metres is correct because a quad driven element is roughly one wavelength long, and 300 divided by 14.3 MHz is close to 21 metres. The other answers are not close to a full wavelength at 14.3 MHz. Memory Trick: ""Quad = full-wave loop, 300 divided by f in MHz."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-004
,
question,What is the approximate length of a delta loop antenna designed for 28.7 MHz?
optionA,3.55 metres
optionB,8.15 metres
optionC,4.98 metres
optionD,10.66 metres
correctOption,D
explanation,"10.66 metres is correct because a delta loop, like a quad loop, is approximately one wavelength long, and 300 divided by 28.7 MHz is a bit over 10 metres. The other options are too short to be a full-wave loop at this frequency. Memory Trick: For both quad and delta loops, start with ""about 300 divided by f in MHz"" for total loop length."
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-005
,
question,"What is a major disadvantage of a quad antenna, as compared to a Yagi antenna with the same number of elements and boom length?"
optionA,More susceptible to weather damage
optionB,Requires a more heavy-duty mast or tower
optionC,Lower gain
optionD,Requires matching to the transmission line
correctOption,A
explanation,"More susceptible to weather damage is correct because quad antennas use wire loops and spreaders that can be stressed by wind, ice, and snow more than solid Yagi elements. The other choices are not generally true when comparing well-designed quads and Yagis of similar size. Memory Trick: Think ""quad loops plus spreaders = more to break in bad weather."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-006
,
question,You are constructing an HF delta loop antenna. It is oriented with the bottom element parallel to the ground. Where should you locate the feed point for horizontal polarization?
optionA,"On a side element, one quarter wavelength from the top"
optionB,In the centre of the bottom element
optionC,In the centre of a side element
optionD,At a junction of the bottom element and a side element
correctOption,B
explanation,"In the centre of the bottom element is correct because feeding the loop on the horizontal side produces predominantly horizontal polarization. Feeding on a vertical side would produce mainly vertical polarization. Memory Trick: ""Feed the flat bottom for flat (horizontal) polarization."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-007
,
question,Moving the feed point of a quad antenna from a side parallel to the ground to a side perpendicular to the ground will have what effect?
optionA,It will significantly decrease the antenna feed point impedance
optionB,It will significantly increase the antenna feed point impedance
optionC,It will change the antenna polarization from horizontal to vertical
optionD,It will change the antenna polarization from vertical to horizontal
correctOption,C
explanation,"It will change the antenna polarization from horizontal to vertical is correct because the polarization is set by the orientation of the side being fed. Feed a horizontal side for horizontal polarization, or a vertical side for vertical polarization. Memory Trick: ""Feed the side that points the way you want the E field to be."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-008
,
question,What is the approximate length of the wire for a horizontal loop tuned at 7.15 MHz?
optionA,41.96 metres
optionB,10.49 metres
optionC,20.00 metres
optionD,42.80 metres
correctOption,D
explanation,"42.80 metres is correct because a common formula for a full-wave horizontal loop in metres is about 306 divided by frequency in MHz, which gives just over 42 metres at 7.15 MHz. The other values are either too short for a full-wave loop or are unrelated lengths. Memory Trick: For HF loops, remember ""about 300 to 306 divided by f in MHz"" for a full-wave loop."
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-009
,
question,The quad antenna consists of two or more square loops of wire. The driven element has an approximate overall length of:
optionA,one wavelength
optionB,three quarters of a wavelength
optionC,two wavelengths
optionD,one half wavelength
correctOption,A
explanation,"One wavelength is correct because each quad loop is a full-wave loop of wire, with the driven element loop being roughly one wavelength long. The other lengths do not give the correct resonance for a standard quad loop. Memory Trick: ""Quad loop = one full wavelength of wire in a square."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-010
,
question,What is the approximate overall length of a delta loop antenna?
optionA,One half of a wavelength
optionB,One wavelength
optionC,One quarter of a wavelength
optionD,Two wavelengths
correctOption,B
explanation,"One wavelength is correct because a delta loop, like a quad loop, is designed as a full-wave loop of wire. The other options describe fractions or multiples that do not correspond to the standard single-loop delta design. Memory Trick: ""Delta or quad, a single loop is about one wavelength long."""
BankQuestionID,B-006-013-011
,
question,What type of wave propagation usually occurs between two nearby VHF transceivers?
optionA,Ionospheric
optionB,Auroral
optionC,Line-of-sight
optionD,Ducting
correctOption,C
explanation,"Line-of-sight is correct because VHF signals normally travel straight from one antenna to the other when the stations are close, slightly bending in the lower atmosphere but still essentially a direct path. The other modes occur only under special conditions. Memory Trick: For local VHF, think ""what you can see is what you can work."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-001
,
question,What does near vertical incidence sky-wave (NVIS) propagation enable?
optionA,Multi-hop HF worldwide communications
optionB,Regional communications above the critical frequency
optionC,Continent-wide communications
optionD,"Medium range HF communications, especially in difficult terrain"
correctOption,D
explanation,"Medium range HF communications, especially in difficult terrain is correct because NVIS uses high-angle radiation that goes almost straight up to the ionosphere and returns nearly straight down, filling in the skip zone out to a few hundred kilometres. Memory Trick: ""NVIS = straight up, straight down, good for nearby but not line-of-sight."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-002
,
question,"When a signal is returned to Earth by the ionosphere, what is this called?"
optionA,Sky-wave propagation
optionB,Tropospheric propagation
optionC,Ground-wave propagation
optionD,Earth-Moon-Earth propagation
correctOption,A
explanation,"Sky-wave propagation is correct because it refers to signals that travel via reflection or refraction in the ionosphere before returning to Earth. The other terms describe different regions or paths, such as troposphere, ground, or the Moon. Memory Trick: ""If it touches the ionosphere and comes back, it is a sky wave."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-003
,
question,"On VHF and higher frequencies, why does the radio horizon extend beyond the visible horizon?"
optionA,Refraction in the D-region
optionB,Normal refraction in the troposphere
optionC,Ionization in the troposphere
optionD,Diffraction caused by soil conductivity
correctOption,B
explanation,"Normal refraction in the troposphere is correct because the atmosphere bends radio waves slightly back toward the Earth, allowing them to follow the curvature of the Earth a bit beyond the optical horizon. The other options describe effects that are not the usual cause of this extension. Memory Trick: Think ""air bends VHF a little"" so you can talk slightly past where you can see."
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-004
,
question,What type of wave is commonly known as sky wave?
optionA,Scattered wave
optionB,Space wave
optionC,Ionospheric wave
optionD,Tropospheric wave
correctOption,C
explanation,"Ionospheric wave is correct because sky waves are defined by their interaction with the ionosphere, where they are refracted or reflected back to Earth. The other terms refer to different propagation regions or mechanisms. Memory Trick: ""Sky wave = ionospheric wave."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-005
,
question,What portion of a radio signal is directly affected by the surface of the Earth?
optionA,Tropospheric wave
optionB,Ionospheric wave
optionC,Scattered wave
optionD,Ground wave
correctOption,D
explanation,"Ground wave is correct because it travels along and is influenced by the Earth's surface, including its conductivity and terrain. The other options refer to waves influenced by the atmosphere or ionosphere instead. Memory Trick: ""If it hugs the ground, it is the ground wave."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-006
,
question,What makes radiocommunication out to 200 km possible at lower HF frequencies during the daytime?
optionA,Ground wave
optionB,Tropospheric ducting
optionC,Skip wave
optionD,Space wave
correctOption,A
explanation,"Ground wave is correct because at lower HF frequencies, the ground wave can follow the Earth for up to a few hundred kilometres, even in daylight when ionospheric skip may not be favorable for that range. Memory Trick: ""Lower HF plus daytime plus a few hundred kilometres usually means ground wave."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-007
,
question,"Considering the bands from 160 metres to 6 metres, which band offers the greatest ground-wave propagation distance?"
optionA,6 metres
optionB,160 metres
optionC,40 metres
optionD,10 metres
correctOption,B
explanation,"160 metres is correct because longer wavelengths are less attenuated by the ground and obstacles, so the ground wave travels farther on the lowest frequency band listed. Memory Trick: ""Longer wavelength, longer ground-wave reach."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-008
,
question,What type of radio wave follows a path from the transmitter to the ionosphere and back to Earth?
optionA,Scattered wave
optionB,Plane wave
optionC,Sky wave
optionD,Direct wave
correctOption,C
explanation,"Sky wave is correct because it specifically describes waves that go up to the ionosphere and then return to Earth, enabling long-distance HF communication. The other terms refer to straight-line or more general wave descriptions. Memory Trick: ""Up to the sky, down again = sky wave."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-009
,
question,Reception of high frequency (HF) radio waves beyond 4000 km is generally made possible by:
optionA,ground wave
optionB,scattered wave
optionC,space wave
optionD,ionospheric wave
correctOption,D
explanation,"Ionospheric wave is correct because long-distance HF communication over several thousand kilometres is usually accomplished by one or more hops via the ionosphere. Ground wave and space wave do not normally reach that far. Memory Trick: ""Very long HF paths usually mean multiple ionospheric hops."""
BankQuestionID,B-007-001-010
,
question,What causes the ionosphere to form?
optionA,Solar radiation ionizing the outer atmosphere
optionB,Lightning ionizing the outer atmosphere
optionC,Release of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere
optionD,Temperature changes ionizing the outer atmosphere
correctOption,A
explanation,"Solar radiation ionizing the outer atmosphere is correct because high-energy radiation from the Sun knocks electrons loose from atoms in the upper atmosphere, creating layers of charged particles (the ionosphere). Lightning, fluorocarbons, and normal temperature changes affect only the lower atmosphere and do not create the large-scale ionized regions needed for HF propagation. Memory Trick: Think “Sunlight strips electrons,” and that stripped layer is the ionosphere."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-001
,
question,What type of solar radiation is most responsible for ionization in the outer atmosphere?
optionA,Infrared
optionB,Ultraviolet
optionC,Microwave
optionD,Ionized particles
correctOption,B
explanation,"Ultraviolet is correct because UV photons are energetic enough to knock electrons free from atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere, producing ionization. Microwave and infrared energy are too low in energy for this job, and ionized particles themselves are more a product than the primary cause. Memory Trick: “UV = Ultra Voltage” in your mind: it has the “kick” to ionize."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-002
,
question,Which ionospheric region is closest to the Earth?
optionA,The F region
optionB,The A region
optionC,The D region
optionD,The E region
correctOption,C
explanation,"The D region is correct because it is the lowest ionospheric layer, forming roughly between about 50–90 km above Earth. The E region lies above the D region, and the F region is even higher. There is no standard “A region.” Memory Trick: Think “D is Down low” in the ionosphere stack (D–E–F)."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-003
,
question,Which region of the ionosphere is the least useful for long-distance radio-wave propagation?
optionA,The F2 region
optionB,The F1 region
optionC,The E region
optionD,The D region
correctOption,D
explanation,"The D region is correct because it mostly absorbs HF signals instead of refracting them back to Earth, especially during daylight. F2, F1, and E can bend HF signals back for long-distance communication, but D mainly causes loss. Memory Trick: “D = Deadening layer” for HF; it eats your signal instead of helping it."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-004
,
question,Which region of the ionosphere separates into two sub-regions in the daytime?
optionA,The F region
optionB,The E region
optionC,The D region
optionD,The G region
correctOption,A
explanation,"The F region is correct because solar radiation during the day splits it into two distinct layers, F1 and F2, which later merge again at night. The D and E layers do not split this way, and there is no standard “G region.” Memory Trick: “F becomes F1 and F2 under the Sun,” so F is the one that fragments."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-005
,
question,When is the ionosphere most ionized?
optionA,Dusk
optionB,Midday
optionC,Dawn
optionD,Midnight
correctOption,B
explanation,"Midday is correct because the Sun is highest in the sky and the ionosphere receives the most intense radiation, maximizing ionization. Around dawn, dusk, and midnight, the Sun’s effect is weaker or absent, so ionization is lower. Memory Trick: Highest Sun = highest ions; think “noon = maximum charge.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-006
,
question,When is ionization at a minimum in the ionosphere?
optionA,Just after dusk
optionB,Shortly before midnight
optionC,Shortly before dawn
optionD,Just after noon
correctOption,C
explanation,"Shortly before dawn is correct because the ionosphere has been in darkness for several hours, allowing recombination of ions and electrons to reduce ionization to its lowest level just before the Sun comes up again. After noon and just after dusk there is still significant recent solar influence. Memory Trick: “Just before sunrise, the ions have had all night to disappear.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-007
,
question,Why is the F2 region mainly responsible for the longest distance radio-wave propagation?
optionA,Because it exists only at night
optionB,Because it is the lowest ionospheric region
optionC,Because it does not absorb radio waves as much as other ionospheric regions
optionD,Because it is the highest ionospheric region
correctOption,D
explanation,"Because it is the highest ionospheric region is correct since a higher reflecting layer produces a longer “hop” distance along Earth’s surface for a given takeoff angle, allowing very long paths with fewer hops. It does not exist only at night, and it is certainly not the lowest layer. Memory Trick: “Higher mirror, longer throw” – the highest “mirror” (F2) gives the longest skip."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-008
,
question,What is the main reason the 160-metre and 80-metre bands tend to be useful only for short-distance communications during daylight hours?
optionA,Because of D region absorption
optionB,Because of signal scattering
optionC,Because of E region ionization
optionD,Because of E region absorption
correctOption,A
explanation,"Because of D region absorption is correct since low-frequency HF (like 160 m and 80 m) is strongly absorbed by the daytime D layer, which prevents long-distance sky-wave paths and leaves mostly local ground-wave coverage. The E region is not the main culprit here. Memory Trick: For 160/80 m in the day, think “D layer = Death to DX.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-009
,
question,"During the day, what two sub-regions appear in the ionosphere?"
optionA,B1 and B2
optionB,F1 and F2
optionC,D1 and D2
optionD,E1 and E2
correctOption,B
explanation,"F1 and F2 is correct because daytime solar radiation splits the F region into two layers. The D and E layers do not commonly get labeled D1/D2 or E1/E2 in HF propagation discussions, and B1/B2 are not standard ionospheric names. Memory Trick: “F splits into F1 and F2 when the Sun is up.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-010
,
question,What is the position of the E region in the ionosphere?
optionA,Above the C region
optionB,Above the F region
optionC,Below the F region
optionD,Below the D region
correctOption,C
explanation,"Below the F region is correct because the vertical order is roughly D (lowest), then E, then F above that. The E region is not below D nor above the F region. “C region” is not a standard layer used in amateur radio propagation questions. Memory Trick: Remember the stack “D–E–F” from Earth upward."
BankQuestionID,B-007-002-011
,
question,"What term describes an area that is too distant for reception of ground waves, but too close for reception of ionospheric waves?"
optionA,Shadow zone
optionB,Scatter zone
optionC,Propagation zone
optionD,Skip zone
correctOption,D
explanation,"Skip zone is correct because it is the region between the end of reliable ground-wave coverage and the point where the first sky-wave (ionospheric) reflection returns to Earth, leaving a “dead zone” for reception. Shadow and scatter zones are different concepts. Memory Trick: “Skip zone = the zone the sky-wave skips over.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-001
,
question,What is the maximum distance along the Earth's surface that is normally covered in one hop using the F2 region?
optionA,4 000 km
optionB,12 000 km
optionC,2 000 km
optionD,300 km
correctOption,A
explanation,"4 000 km is correct because typical single-hop distances via the F2 layer are on the order of a few thousand kilometres, with 4000 km being a common approximate maximum in exam questions. 2000 km is more typical for E-layer hops, and 12 000 km would generally require multiple hops. Memory Trick: Think “F2 = Farther: around 4000 km per hop.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-002
,
question,What is the maximum distance along the Earth's surface that is normally covered in one hop using the E region?
optionA,1000 km
optionB,2000 km
optionC,300 km
optionD,4000 km
correctOption,B
explanation,"2000 km is correct because the E layer is lower than F2, so one-hop paths are shorter, typically up to around 2000 km under normal conditions. 4000 km fits F2 better, and the shorter distances are too small for typical maximum E-hop ranges. Memory Trick: “E is Earlier (lower), so hops are about half of F2: around 2000 km.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-003
,
question,Skip zone is:
optionA,a zone between any two refracted waves
optionB,a zone between the antenna and the return of the first refracted wave
optionC,a zone between the end of the ground wave and the point where the first ionosphere-refracted wave returns to Earth
optionD,a zone of silence caused by lost sky waves
correctOption,C
explanation,"A zone between the end of the ground wave and the point where the first ionosphere-refracted wave returns to Earth is correct because that region has neither strong ground-wave nor first-hop sky-wave coverage, producing weak or no signals. The other descriptions are incomplete or incorrect. Memory Trick: Picture a “gap” between ground coverage and the first sky-wave landing point—that gap is the skip zone."
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-004
,
question,The distance to Europe from your location is approximately 5000 km. What type of high frequency (HF) propagation is the most likely to work?
optionA,"Sporadic ""E"""
optionB,Back scatter
optionC,Tropospheric scatter
optionD,Multi-hop
correctOption,D
explanation,"Multi-hop is correct because a 5000 km path is longer than a typical single F2 or E hop, so the signal must usually make two or more bounces between the ionosphere and Earth to span that distance. Sporadic E can be unpredictable and usually covers shorter hops, and tropospheric scatter is mainly a VHF/UHF phenomenon. Memory Trick: “Beyond one hop? Think more hops: multi-hop.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-005
,
question,"Assuming constant ionosphere region height, how does a higher radiation angle affect skip distance?"
optionA,"It decreases, due to the geometry of the signal path"
optionB,"It decreases, due to the decrease in critical frequency"
optionC,"It increases, due to the geometry of the signal path"
optionD,"It increases, due to the increase in critical frequency"
correctOption,A
explanation,"It decreases, due to the geometry of the signal path is correct because sending energy more straight up makes it come back down closer to the station, producing a shorter skip distance. Lower angles go out farther before returning. Critical frequency is a property of the layer, not the angle from your antenna. Memory Trick: “High angle = high up, but not far out.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-006
,
question,"On a double-hop path involving the surface of the Earth as a middle point, what phenomenon returns the radio wave to the ionosphere?"
optionA,Scattering
optionB,Reflection
optionC,Refraction
optionD,Diffraction
correctOption,B
explanation,"Reflection is correct because, after the first ionospheric hop, the wave strikes the Earth and is reflected back upward toward the ionosphere for the second hop. Refraction is what the ionosphere does; the Earth behaves more like a reflecting surface for HF. Memory Trick: “Ionosphere bends (refraction), Earth bounces (reflection).”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-007
,
question,Skip distance is the:
optionA,minimum distance reached by a ground-wave signal
optionB,maximum distance a signal will travel by both a ground wave and reflected wave
optionC,minimum distance reached by a signal after one reflection by the ionosphere
optionD,maximum distance reached by a signal after one reflection by the ionosphere
correctOption,C
explanation,"Minimum distance reached by a signal after one reflection by the ionosphere is correct because skip distance is measured from the transmitter to the first point where the returning sky-wave becomes usable, marking the inner edge of ionospheric coverage. The maximum distance for one hop is a different concept. Memory Trick: “Skip distance is where the first sky-wave finally lands, not where it ends.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-008
,
question,Skip is a term associated with signals from the ionosphere. What causes skip?
optionA,Selective fading of local signals
optionB,High gain antennas are being used
optionC,Local cloud cover
optionD,Refraction by the ionosphere
correctOption,D
explanation,"Refraction by the ionosphere is correct because the ionized layers bend (refract) HF signals back toward Earth, making them seem to “skip” over intermediate distances. High-gain antennas or cloud cover do not create ionospheric skip, and selective fading is a separate propagation effect. Memory Trick: “Ionosphere bends the wave back: that bending is what gives you ‘skip.’”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-009
,
question,The skip distance of a sky wave will be greatest when the:
optionA,angle between the ground and the emitted radiation is smallest
optionB,polarization is vertical
optionC,ionosphere is most densely ionized
optionD,signal given out is strongest
correctOption,A
explanation,"angle between the ground and the emitted radiation is smallest is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing. The other answers either overstate, understate, or describe a different situation. Memory Trick: Focus on the central idea of the question and pair it firmly with this answer in your mind."
BankQuestionID,B-007-003-010
,
question,How does an increase in the height of the refracting region affect skip distance?
optionA,"It increases, due to the geometry of the signal path"

optionC,"It decreases, due to the geometry of the signal path"
optionD,"It decreases, due to the increase in critical frequency"

question,What effect does the D region of the ionosphere have on lower frequency HF waves in the daytime?
optionA,It absorbs the waves
optionB,It bends the radio waves out into space
optionC,It refracts the radio waves back to Earth
optionD,It distorts the waves
correctOption,A
explanation,"It absorbs the waves is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing. The other answers either overstate, understate, or describe a different situation. Memory Trick: Focus on the central idea of the question and pair it firmly with this answer in your mind."
BankQuestionID,B-007-004-001

question,Why can you not hear distant 160-metre and AM broadcast stations during daytime hours?
optionA,The ionization of the D region
optionB,The presence of ionized clouds in the E region
optionC,The splitting of the F region into two sub-regions
optionD,The weather below the ionosphere
correctOption,A

optionB,Wavering
optionC,Absorption

correctOption,A

,
question,"While using a 2-metre hand-held transceiver in an urban setting, you notice that moving less than one metre can severely attenuate your received signal. What is the likely cause?"
optionA,Signals arriving on different paths cancel one another
optionB,Overhead power lines create a Faraday cage
optionC,Underground conduits change ground conductivity
optionD,Passing vehicles absorb the radio signals
correctOption,A

,
question,A transmitted radio signal reaches a receiver by both one-hop and two-hop skip paths. What can small changes in the ionosphere cause?
optionA,Variations in signal strength
optionB,Consistently weaker signals
optionC,Consistently stronger signals
optionD,A shift in signal frequency
correctOption,A

optionA,Try a higher frequency band
optionB,Try the other sideband
optionC,Try a different antenna polarization
optionD,Try a different frequency shift

BankQuestionID,B-007-004-006
,
question,"On the VHF and UHF bands, the polarization of the receiving antenna in relation to the transmitting antenna is very important, yet on HF bands it is relatively unimportant. Why is that so?"
optionA,The refraction in the ionosphere changes the wave's polarization
optionB,The polarization of ground waves and ionospheric waves continually varies
optionC,The refraction forces the wave's polarization to vertical
optionD,The polarization of ionospheric waves varies depending on the entry angle into the refracting region
correctOption,A
explanation,"The refraction in the ionosphere changes the wave's polarization is correct because it reflects how this antenna type actually behaves&#8212;its pattern, gain, or polarization. The other options describe patterns or properties that do not match the real antenna. Memory Trick: Picture the antenna in your mind and imagine where most of the energy goes to anchor the concept."
BankQuestionID,B-007-004-007
,
question,What causes selective fading?
optionA,"Phase differences between radio wave components of the same transmission, as experienced at the receiving station"
optionB,Small changes in directional antenna heading at the receiving station
optionC,Time differences between the receiving and transmitting stations

BankQuestionID,B-007-004-008
,
question,How does the bandwidth of a transmitted signal affect selective fading?
optionA,It is more pronounced at wide bandwidths
optionB,It is the same for both wide and narrow bandwidths
optionC,Only the receiver bandwidth determines the selective fading effect
optionD,It is more pronounced at narrow bandwidths

optionA,Change the polarization
optionB,Increase the speed of propagation
optionC,Increase the occupied bandwidth
optionD,Change the wavelength
correctOption,A
explanation,"Change the polarization is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing.

optionA,Phase distortion
optionB,Frequency shift
optionC,Heterodyne squeal

optionA,"The more sunspots there are, the greater the ionization"
optionB,"The more sunspots there are, the lesser the ionization"
optionC,"Unless there are sunspots, the ionization is zero"
optionD,They have no effect
correctOption,A

optionA,11 years
optionB,17 years

optionC,The number of sunspots on the side of the sun facing the Earth
optionD,The density of the sun's magnetic field
correctOption,A
explanation,"The radio frequency energy emitted by the sun is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing.

question,What influences all radiocommunication beyond ground wave or line-of-sight ranges?
optionA,Solar radiation
optionB,The F2 region of the ionosphere
optionC,The F1 region of the ionosphere
optionD,Lunar tidal effects
correctOption,A
explanation,"Solar radiation is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing. The other answers either overstate, understate, or describe a different situation.

,
question,What effect of the sun's activity influences ionospheric propagation on a daily basis?
optionA,Electromagnetic and particle radiation
optionB,Solar wind
optionC,Infrared radiation
optionD,Coronal mass ejections (CME)
correctOption,A
explanation,"Electromagnetic and particle radiation is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing.

BankQuestionID,B-007-005-006
,
question,"When sunspot numbers are high, how is propagation affected?"
optionA,Frequencies up to 40 MHz or even higher become usable for long-distance communication
optionB,High frequency radio signals are absorbed
optionC,Frequencies up to 100 MHz or higher are normally usable for long-distance communication
optionD,High frequency radio signals become weak and distorted
correctOption,A
explanation,"Frequencies up to 40 MHz or even higher become usable for long-distance communication is correct because it matches the technical or regulatory fact the question is testing. The other answers either overstate, understate, or describe a different situation. Memory Trick: Focus on the central idea of the question and pair it firmly with this answer in your mind."
BankQuestionID,B-007-005-007
,
question,All communication frequencies throughout the spectrum are affected in varying degrees by:
optionA,the sun
optionB,the ionosphere
optionC,auroras
optionD,meteor showers
correctOption,A
explanation,"The sun is correct because solar radiation and solar activity (sunspots, flares, CMEs) influence all parts of the spectrum, either directly or indirectly—HF through the ionosphere, VHF/UHF through noise levels and slight bending, even higher bands through space weather effects. The ionosphere, auroras, and meteor showers only affect certain ranges or modes. Memory Trick: Think “everything starts with the Sun” – if it’s radio propagation, the Sun is always in the story somewhere."
BankQuestionID,B-007-005-008
,
question,Average duration of a solar cycle is:
optionA,1 year
optionB,11 years
optionC,3 years
optionD,6 years
correctOption,B
explanation,"11 years is correct because the sunspot cycle, which drives long-term changes in HF propagation, averages about 11 years from one maximum to the next. The other numbers don’t match the observed long-term solar cycle. Memory Trick: Picture “11 spots on the Sun” to remember 11-year sunspot cycle."
BankQuestionID,B-007-005-009
,
question,The ability of the ionosphere to refract high frequency radio signals depends on:
optionA,the receiver sensitivity
optionB,upper atmosphere weather conditions
optionC,the amount of solar radiation
optionD,the power of the transmitted signal
correctOption,C
explanation,"The amount of solar radiation is correct because UV and X-ray energy from the Sun ionize the upper atmosphere, creating the layers that bend HF signals back to Earth. Transmitter power and receiver sensitivity affect how well you communicate, not how much the ionosphere bends the wave. Memory Trick: “More Sun → more ions → more bending.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-005-010
,
question,What is the major cause of cyclical changes in HF propagation?
optionA,Magnetic pole drift cycle
optionB,Jet stream cycle
optionC,Auroral cycle
optionD,Solar cycle
correctOption,D
explanation,"Solar cycle is correct because the roughly 11-year variation in sunspot numbers changes ionization levels and therefore HF propagation quality over time. Magnetic pole drift and jet streams are much slower or mostly affect other phenomena, not the classic HF cycle questions. Memory Trick: When you hear “cyclical HF propagation,” think “cyclical Sun = solar cycle.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-005-011
,
question,Observatories probe the ionosphere at vertical incidence. What term describes the highest frequency that a region can reflect at the time?
optionA,Critical frequency
optionB,Maximum usable frequency
optionC,Optimum working frequency
optionD,Doppler frequency
correctOption,A
explanation,"Critical frequency is correct because it’s defined as the highest frequency that will be returned to Earth when sent straight up (vertical incidence) into a specific ionospheric layer. MUF and OWF relate to oblique paths between two points on Earth, not vertical probing. Memory Trick: “Critical = straight up test limit.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-001
,
question,What causes the maximum usable frequency to vary?
optionA,The type of weather just below the ionosphere
optionB,The amount of radiation received from the sun
optionC,The temperature of the ionosphere
optionD,The speed of the winds in the upper atmosphere
correctOption,B
explanation,"The amount of radiation received from the sun is correct because MUF depends on how strongly the ionosphere is ionized, and that is controlled mainly by solar UV and X-ray output (plus time of day, season, and solar cycle). Winds and normal weather have only minor or indirect effects on MUF. Memory Trick: “More Sun power, more MUF power.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-002
,
question,What does maximum usable frequency mean?
optionA,The highest frequency that is most absorbed by the ionosphere
optionB,The lowest frequency that is most absorbed by the ionosphere
optionC,The highest frequency at which a signal will reach a given destination
optionD,The lowest frequency at which a signal will reach a given destination
correctOption,C
explanation,"The highest frequency at which a signal will reach a given destination is correct: above the MUF, the wave passes through the ionosphere instead of being bent back, so the path fails. Options C and D confuse MUF with absorption, which is a different issue. Memory Trick: MUF = “Max Up Frequency” that still comes back down to your target."
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-003
,
question,Why is communication possible between two continents at a frequency above the local critical frequency?
optionA,The sun's relative position differs between the two locations
optionB,Ionization is not uniform around the globe
optionC,A higher frequency cuts through absorption more easily
optionD,The signal enters the ionosphere at an oblique (inclined) angle
correctOption,D
explanation,"The signal enters the ionosphere at an oblique (inclined) angle is correct because at an angle the wave travels a longer path through a layer, so it can be bent back at higher frequencies than a straight-up (critical frequency) test would suggest. That’s why MUF is higher than the vertical critical frequency. Memory Trick: “Slanted in = higher usable frequency.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-004
,
question,What is one way to determine if the maximum usable frequency (MUF) is high enough to support 28 MHz propagation between your station and western Europe?
optionA,Listen for 10-metre beacon stations
optionB,Listen for 20-metre beacon stations
optionC,Listen for 31-metre broadcast stations
optionD,Listen for WWVH time signals on 15 MHz
correctOption,A
explanation,"Listen for 10-metre beacon stations is correct because 28 MHz is in the 10-metre band; if you hear beacons in that region coming from Europe, the MUF between you and that area is at least high enough for 10-metre propagation. Listening on other bands doesn’t directly confirm MUF at 28 MHz. Memory Trick: “Check the band you care about—10 m beacons for 10 m MUF.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-005
,
question,What usually happens to radio waves with frequencies below the maximum usable frequency (MUF) when they are sent into the ionosphere?
optionA,They pass through the ionosphere
optionB,They are bent back to the Earth
optionC,They are changed to a frequency above the MUF
optionD,They are completely absorbed by the ionosphere
correctOption,B
explanation,"They are bent back to the Earth is correct because as long as the frequency is below MUF (and above the lower usable frequency for that path), the ionosphere refracts the wave enough for it to return to Earth. Frequencies above MUF tend to pass through. Memory Trick: “Below MUF? It comes back. Above MUF? It goes out.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-006
,
question,At what point in the solar cycle does the 20-metre band usually support worldwide propagation during daylight hours?
optionA,Only at the maximum point of the solar cycle
optionB,At the beginning of the solar cycle
optionC,At any point in the solar cycle
optionD,Only at the minimum point of the solar cycle
correctOption,C
explanation,"At any point in the solar cycle is correct for exam purposes because 20 m is a “workhorse” HF band: even at solar minimum it often still supports long-distance daylight paths somewhere in the world, and at solar maximum it becomes even better. The other answers limit 20-m usefulness too much. Memory Trick: Think “20 m = 24/7/365 workhorse,” usable throughout the whole cycle."
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-007
,
question,What happens daily when the solar UV radiation increases?
optionA,The atmospheric noise level decreases
optionB,Ground wave propagation decreases
optionC,Weather in the ionosphere changes
optionD,The maximum usable frequency increases
correctOption,D
explanation,"The maximum usable frequency increases is correct because stronger UV radiation means more ionization, which allows higher frequencies to be bent back to Earth. The other options are not the primary direct effect of increased solar UV on HF propagation. Memory Trick: “More UV → more ions → higher MUF.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-008
,
question,When is propagation on the 80-metre band generally the LEAST effective?
optionA,Daytime in summer
optionB,Evening in winter
optionC,Evening in summer
optionD,Daytime in winter
correctOption,A
explanation,"Daytime in summer is correct because 80 m suffers heavy D-layer absorption in the day, and this is worst when the days are longest and the Sun is highest (summer). Evenings and winter nights typically give much better 80-m conditions. Memory Trick: “80 m hates hot, bright days.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-009
,
question,"The optimum working frequency provides the best long-range HF communication. Compared with the maximum usable frequency (MUF), it is usually:"
optionA,slightly higher
optionB,slightly lower
optionC,double the MUF
optionD,half the MUF
correctOption,B
explanation,"Slightly lower is correct because using a frequency just below MUF gives more reliable, stable communications with less fading and fewer dropouts than operating right at the limit. Values like 0.8–0.9 × MUF are often used as a rule of thumb. Memory Trick: “Aim just under the ceiling: OWF = MUF minus a little.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-010
,
question,"During summer daytime, which bands are the most difficult for communications beyond ground wave?"
optionA,30 metres
optionB,20 metres
optionC,160 metres and 80 metres
optionD,40 metres
correctOption,C
explanation,"160 metres and 80 metres is correct because strong D-layer absorption during long, bright summer days greatly attenuates low-frequency HF sky waves, leaving mostly ground-wave coverage. Higher bands can still refract via E or F regions. Memory Trick: “Lowest bands lose most in summer sun.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-006-011
,
question,Which ionospheric region most affects sky-wave propagation on the 6-metre band?
optionA,The F2 region
optionB,The F1 region
optionC,The D region
optionD,The E region
correctOption,D
explanation,"The E region is correct because on 6 m, notable long-distance sky-wave propagation is often due to sporadic-E, where dense patches of ionization in the E layer reflect VHF signals. F-layer propagation on 6 m happens but is less common; D-layer mainly absorbs, not refracts. Memory Trick: “Six metres loves Es—E layer, especially sporadic-E.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-001
,
question,What effect does tropospheric bending have on 2-metre radio waves?
optionA,It lets you contact stations farther away
optionB,It causes them to travel shorter distances
optionC,It distorts the signal
optionD,It interferes with short-range communications
correctOption,A
explanation,"It lets you contact stations farther away is correct because slight bending or “ducting” in the troposphere can extend the radio horizon beyond simple line-of-sight, giving unusually long VHF paths. While there can be some distortion, the key exam idea is extended range. Memory Trick: “Tropo bend = bonus distance.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-002
,
question,What causes tropospheric ducting of radio waves?
optionA,A very low-pressure area
optionB,A temperature inversion
optionC,Lightning between the transmitting and receiving stations
optionD,An aurora to the north
correctOption,B
explanation,"A temperature inversion is correct because layers of warm air above cooler air create sharp changes in refractive index that can trap VHF/UHF signals and guide them over long distances, like a “duct.” Lightning and auroras are unrelated mechanisms. Memory Trick: “Warm-over-cold air = radio duct.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-003
,
question,What term describes that portion of a transmitted wave kept close to the Earth's surface due to bending in the atmosphere?
optionA,Ground wave
optionB,Ionospheric wave
optionC,Tropospheric wave
optionD,Scattered wave
correctOption,C
explanation,"Tropospheric wave is correct because this refers to VHF/UHF signals that follow Earth’s surface via refraction in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere). “Ground wave” in HF usually refers to surface/ground-hugging propagation from the antenna, not specifically bending by the troposphere. Memory Trick: “Near-surface but air-bent at VHF = tropospheric wave.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-004
,
question,What is a sporadic-E condition?
optionA,Occasional duct formation in the E region
optionB,Variations in E-region height caused by sunspot variations
optionC,A brief decrease in VHF signals caused by sunspot variations
optionD,Patches of dense ionization at E-region height
correctOption,D
explanation,"Patches of dense ionization at E-region height is correct because sporadic-E occurs when irregular, highly ionized “clouds” form in the E layer, reflecting HF and lower-VHF signals over long distances on otherwise “dead” bands. The other answers confuse it with ducts or sunspot effects. Memory Trick: “Sporadic-E = surprise ionized patches in the E layer.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-005
,
question,On which amateur radio band is the extended-distance propagation effect of sporadic-E most often observed?
optionA,6 metres
optionB,160 metres
optionC,20 metres
optionD,2 metres
correctOption,A
explanation,"6 metres is correct because sporadic-E often creates dramatic “openings” on the low-VHF range, especially around 50 MHz. HF bands like 20 metres are usually dominated by F-layer propagation, and 160 metres is too low in frequency for typical sporadic-E effects. Memory Trick: Think “Sporadic-E = Summer Six Metres.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-006
,
question,"In the northern hemisphere, in which direction should a directional antenna be pointed to take maximum advantage of auroral propagation?"
optionA,South
optionB,North
optionC,East
optionD,West
correctOption,B
explanation,"North is correct because auroral propagation occurs in the auroral zone around the geomagnetic poles. From most locations in the northern hemisphere, that lies to the north, so you point your beam toward the aurora. Memory Trick: “Aurora = Northern Lights = point the beam north.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-007
,
question,Where in the ionosphere does auroral activity occur?
optionA,In the equatorial band
optionB,At D-region height
optionC,At E-region height
optionD,At F-region height
correctOption,C
explanation,"At E-region height is correct because auroral emissions and related radio effects occur mainly in the E region, roughly 90–150 km up. The F region is higher, and the D region is lower and mainly associated with absorption, not aurora. Memory Trick: “Aurora and E both sit in the middle of the alphabet: A–D–E–F.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-008
,
question,Which analog emission mode is the most reliable in auroral propagation?
optionA,"CW, because it resists fading"
optionB,"FM, because it is readable even when distorted"
optionC,"FM, because it resists fading"
optionD,"CW, because it is readable even when distorted"
correctOption,D
explanation,"CW, because it is readable even when distorted is correct since auroral signals are often rough, hissy, and severely distorted. A simple on/off Morse signal is still recognizable through that distortion, whereas voice or FM can become unintelligible. Memory Trick: “When signals get ugly in the aurora, CW still cuts through.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-009
,
question,"Excluding enhanced propagation modes, what is the approximate range of normal VHF tropospheric propagation?"
optionA,800 km
optionB,2400 km
optionC,3200 km
optionD,1600 km
correctOption,A
explanation,800 km is correct as a typical upper limit for extended but still “normal” tropospheric propagation at VHF. Longer paths usually require special modes such as strong ducting or other enhancements. Memory Trick: Think of “VHF normal limit” as “about 800 km or so” before you start suspecting special conditions.
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-010
,
question,What effect is responsible for propagating a VHF signal over 800 km?
optionA,Ionospheric refraction
optionB,Tropospheric ducting
optionC,Faraday rotation
optionD,D-region refraction
correctOption,B
explanation,"Tropospheric ducting is correct because unusual temperature and humidity layers in the lower atmosphere can trap and guide VHF signals far beyond the normal radio horizon, often out to 800 km or more. Faraday rotation affects polarization, and D-region or ionospheric refraction is mainly an HF phenomenon. Memory Trick: “Super-long VHF over water or temperature inversions? That’s a duct.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-007-011
,
question,What kind of unusual HF propagation allows weak signals from the skip zone to be heard?
optionA,Ducting
optionB,Ground wave
optionC,Scatter-mode
optionD,Sky-wave with low radiation angle
correctOption,C
explanation,"Scatter-mode is correct because some of the transmitted energy is scattered in many directions by irregularities in the ionosphere or atmosphere, letting a small amount fall into the skip zone—an area normally silent between ground wave and first sky-wave hop. Memory Trick: “Skip zone sound? Think scattered around.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-001
,
question,"If you receive a weak, distorted signal close to the maximum usable frequency, what type of propagation is probably occurring?"
optionA,Ground wave
optionB,Line-of-sight
optionC,Ducting
optionD,Scatter
correctOption,D
explanation,"Scatter is correct because near the MUF, normal F-layer refraction is marginal and more of the energy is scattered. That scattered component tends to sound weak, fluttery, and distorted. Ground wave and line-of-sight are typically stronger and cleaner. Memory Trick: “Near MUF + weak and rough = scatter stuff.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-002
,
question,What type of VHF/UHF propagation depends upon small variations in density and water-vapour content?
optionA,Tropospheric scatter
optionB,Tropospheric ducting
optionC,Ionospheric scatter
optionD,Sporadic-E
correctOption,A
explanation,"Tropospheric scatter is correct because tiny irregularities in the lower atmosphere’s density and humidity cause a small fraction of the signal to scatter in many directions, enabling weak but reliable beyond-horizon VHF/UHF paths. Ducting uses more pronounced layers; sporadic-E and ionospheric scatter happen much higher. Memory Trick: “Tiny tropo ripples = tiny scattered signals.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-003
,
question,What makes HF scatter signals often sound distorted?
optionA,The state of the E-region at the point of refraction
optionB,Energy scattered into the skip zone through several radio-wave paths
optionC,Auroral activity and changes in the Earth's magnetic field
optionD,Propagation through ground waves that absorb much of the signal
correctOption,B
explanation,"Energy scattered into the skip zone through several radio-wave paths is correct because multiple scattered paths with slightly different delays combine at the receiver, causing phase distortion, flutter, and a “burbling” sound. Memory Trick: “Many tiny paths, many tiny delays = messy audio.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-004
,
question,Why are HF scatter signals usually weak?
optionA,The F region of the ionosphere absorbs most of the signal energy
optionB,Auroral activity absorbs most of the signal energy
optionC,Only a small part of the signal energy is scattered into the skip zone
optionD,Propagation through ground waves absorbs most of the signal energy
correctOption,C
explanation,"Only a small part of the signal energy is scattered into the skip zone is correct because most of the transmitted power keeps going on the main paths; only a tiny fraction is deflected to serve the skip zone, so received signals are weak. Memory Trick: “Scatter is scraps—only scraps of power reach you.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-005
,
question,What type of propagation may allow a weak high frequency (HF) signal to be heard at a distance too far for ground-wave propagation but too near for normal sky-wave propagation?
optionA,Short-path skip
optionB,Sporadic-E skip
optionC,Tropospheric scatter
optionD,Scatter
correctOption,D
explanation,"Scatter is correct because this specific situation (inside the normal skip zone) is classic HF scatter territory. Short-path skip and sporadic-E are still forms of sky-wave and typically leave a skip zone; tropo scatter mainly affects VHF/UHF. Memory Trick: “If you’re in the skip hole but still hear something, think scatter.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-006
,
question,"On the HF bands, when is scatter propagation most likely involved?"
optionA,When you receive weak and distorted signals near the maximum usable frequency (MUF)
optionB,When the sunspot cycle is at a minimum and D-region absorption is high
optionC,At night when propagation is poor
optionD,When the F1 and F2 regions are combined
correctOption,A
explanation,"When you receive weak and distorted signals near the maximum usable frequency (MUF) is correct because that’s when normal refraction is failing and scattered components dominate, giving the classic “thin, rough” scatter sound. Memory Trick: “Near MUF + ugly audio = scatter at work.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-007
,
question,Tropospheric scatter frequently explains VHF/UHF communications well beyond the radio horizon. What makes this propagation mode possible?
optionA,Local cloud cover
optionB,Small variations in the properties of the lower atmosphere
optionC,Ionized patches in the troposphere
optionD,Increased daytime ionization of the D region
correctOption,B
explanation,"Small variations in the properties of the lower atmosphere is correct because tiny fluctuations in refractive index—caused by temperature and humidity variations—scatter a little of the signal forward, allowing beyond-line-of-sight reception. Memory Trick: “Slightly lumpy air gives slightly stretched range.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-008
,
question,Meteor scatter is most effective on what band?
optionA,15 metres
optionB,160 metres
optionC,6 metres
optionD,40 metres
correctOption,C
explanation,6 metres is correct because meteor trails are especially effective at reflecting low-VHF signals around 50 MHz. HF bands like 40 and 15 metres usually use normal ionospheric propagation; 160 metres is far too low in frequency for classic meteor-scatter modes. Memory Trick: “Meteors + Magic = 6-metre pings.”
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-009
,
question,What is the effect of scattering on a radio wave?
optionA,The wave is gradually bent
optionB,A portion of the wave abruptly changes direction
optionC,The wave is absorbed by the medium
optionD,The wave gets redirected in many directions
correctOption,D
explanation,"The wave gets redirected in many directions is correct because scattering breaks up the original beam into many weaker components going off at different angles. Gradual bending is refraction, abrupt single changes are reflection, and absorption simply removes energy. Memory Trick: “Scatter = shatter the beam into many pieces.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-010
,
question,In which frequency range is meteor scatter most effective for extended-range communication?
optionA,30 MHz to 100 MHz
optionB,10 MHz to 30 MHz
optionC,3 MHz to 10 MHz
optionD,100 MHz to 150 MHz
correctOption,A
explanation,"30 MHz to 100 MHz is correct because meteor trails ionize strongly enough and have suitable lifetimes to reflect signals in the low-VHF region. Below this range, normal ionospheric propagation tends to dominate; above it, the trails are often too small or short-lived to be useful. Memory Trick: “Meteor sweet spot = low VHF window.”"
BankQuestionID,B-007-008-011
,
question,What is the cause of receiver overload?
optionA,Overmodulation of a transmitter
optionB,Very strong signal from a transmitter
optionC,Frequency instability of a transmitter
optionD,Parasitic oscillations in a transmitter
correctOption,B
explanation,"Very strong signal from a transmitter is correct because overload happens when a signal is so strong it drives the front end or IF stages of the receiver beyond their linear range, causing distortion and spurious responses. Instability, oscillations, or overmodulation may cause other issues but not overload by themselves. Memory Trick: “Too big a signal = receiver says ‘I can’t handle it.’”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-001
,
question,What is one way to tell if your HF transmitter causes front-end overload interference to a neighbour's receiver?
optionA,Interference is heard regardless of the volume setting on the receiver
optionB,Adding a low-pass filter at the transmitter solves the problem
optionC,Transmitting on various frequencies produces similar interference
optionD,Adding receiver shielding has no effect
correctOption,C
explanation,"Transmitting on various frequencies produces similar interference is correct because overload is mostly about signal strength, not your exact transmit frequency. If changing bands doesn’t change the interference much, it points to the neighbour’s receiver front end being swamped. Memory Trick: “If every band breaks their gear, it’s overload, not ‘bad band.’”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-002
,
question,"If a neighbour reports television interference whenever you transmit, no matter what band you use, what is probably the cause of the interference?"
optionA,Incorrect antenna length
optionB,Spurious emissions
optionC,Deficient harmonic suppression
optionD,Receiver overload
correctOption,D
explanation,"Receiver overload is correct because if every band causes interference, the neighbour’s TV front end is probably being driven too hard by your strong RF signal. Harmonics or spurious signals are usually more frequency-specific. Memory Trick: “All bands, same problem = their receiver is overloaded.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-003
,
question,What type of filter should be connected to a TV receiver as the first step in trying to prevent receiver overload from an amateur radio HF transmission?
optionA,High-pass
optionB,Low-pass
optionC,Band-pass
optionD,AC line filter
correctOption,A
explanation,"High-pass is correct because a TV uses VHF/UHF, which are much higher in frequency than HF. A high-pass filter at the TV input attenuates the strong HF signal while passing the wanted TV channels. A low-pass would do the opposite, a band-pass would be too narrow and band-specific, and an AC line filter only affects mains power, not RF on the antenna input. Memory Trick: “TV lives high — protect it with high-pass.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-004
,
question,"During a club Field Day outing, reception on the 20-metre SSB station is compromised every time the 20-metre CW station is on the air. What might cause such interference?"
optionA,Harmonic emission
optionB,Receiver desensitization
optionC,Both stations are fed from the same generator
optionD,Improper station grounding
correctOption,B
explanation,"Receiver desensitization is correct because the very strong nearby CW signal is overloading the front end of the SSB receiver on the same band, reducing its sensitivity to weaker signals. Sharing a generator or imperfect grounding might cause hum or noise, not this “goes deaf when the other station transmits” effect. Harmonics would show up on other bands, not mainly the same one. Memory Trick: “Strong neighbour on same band = your receiver gets ‘deaf’ (desensed).”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-005
,
question,The signals from two commercial transmitters combine outside your receiver to produce noise on a desired frequency. What type of interference is this?
optionA,Receiver overload
optionB,Harmonic emissions
optionC,Intermodulation
optionD,Spurious emissions
correctOption,C
explanation,"Intermodulation is correct because two (or more) strong signals are mixing in a nonlinear device (often in the receiver front end or nearby metalwork), creating new “combo” frequencies that fall on your desired channel. Spurious and harmonic emissions refer to unwanted outputs from a single transmitter. Overload is just “too much signal,” but here the key is mixing. Memory Trick: Think “IMD = ‘I Mix Distortion.’”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-006
,
question,You have connected your hand-held VHF transceiver to an outside gain antenna. You now hear a mixture of signals together with different modulation on your desired frequency. What is the nature of this interference?
optionA,Harmonics from other stations
optionB,Audio stage overload
optionC,Audio stage intermodulation
optionD,Receiver intermodulation
correctOption,D
explanation,"Receiver intermodulation is correct because the external gain antenna is overloading the radio’s front end with many strong signals. These mix together in the RF stages and create extra signals on your receive frequency. Harmonics are multiples of a single transmitter’s frequency, and audio-stage problems don’t normally create new RF frequencies. Memory Trick: “Big antenna + crowded band = IMD inside the receiver.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-007
,
question,Two or more strong signals mix in your receiver to produce interference on a desired frequency. What is this called?
optionA,Intermodulation interference
optionB,Harmonic interference
optionC,Capture effect
optionD,Front-end desensitization
correctOption,A
explanation,"Intermodulation interference is correct because multiple strong signals are mixing in a nonlinear stage (like the RF amplifier or mixer), creating new, unwanted signals. Harmonic interference comes from multiples of a single signal, capture effect is an FM phenomenon where the strongest signal wins, and desensitization is loss of sensitivity rather than creation of new frequencies. Memory Trick: “When strong signals inter-mix, think intermodulation.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-008
,
question,"Two mobile stations are communicating through a repeater. As they arrive in close proximity to each other, they begin to have difficulty communicating. What is the most likely cause?"
optionA,Transmitter signals are mixing with the repeater signal to cause intermodulation
optionB,Transmitter signals are desensitizing the receivers
optionC,CTCSS tones are activating the receivers' squelch circuits
optionD,They have entered a null area of their antenna patterns
correctOption,B
explanation,"Transmitter signals are desensitizing the receivers is correct because as the mobiles get close, their transmit signals can be very strong at each other’s receiver, overloading or desensing them, especially in duplex/repeater use. CTCSS issues affect access to the repeater, not local desense. Antenna nulls are possible but less likely in this specific “very close together” scenario, and mixing with the repeater signal is a more complex case than needed here. Memory Trick: “Too-close mobiles = too-much signal = desense.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-009
,
question,A television receiver suffers interference on channel 5 (76 MHz - 82 MHz) only when you transmit on 14 MHz. From your home you see the tower of a commercial FM station known to broadcast on 92.5 MHz. Which of these solutions would you try first?
optionA,Insert a high-pass filter at the HF transmitter
optionB,Insert a low-pass filter at the television receiver
optionC,Insert a high-pass filter at the television receiver
optionD,Insert a low-pass filter at the HF transmitter
correctOption,C
explanation,"Insert a high-pass filter at the television receiver is correct because it will attenuate your 14 MHz HF signal while passing the VHF TV and FM broadcast signals. The problem is likely intermodulation in the TV front end between your HF and the strong local FM station. A high-pass at your transmitter doesn’t protect the TV; a low-pass at the TV would pass HF and reject TV signals—the opposite of what you want. Memory Trick: “TV uses high frequencies, so protect it with high-pass.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-010
,
question,You are experiencing interference in your VHF receiver. You have determined that signals from two nearby transmitters are mixing in your receiver to cause the interference. What device can you install to reduce the interference?
optionA,Common-mode choke
optionB,RF attenuator
optionC,Narrow band IF filter
optionD,Suitable filter at the receiver
correctOption,D
explanation,"Suitable filter at the receiver is correct because by limiting the range of frequencies reaching your front end (for example with a band-pass filter for just your band), you keep out one or both of the strong off-channel signals that are causing intermodulation. A common-mode choke fixes RF on cables, an attenuator just weakens everything, and an IF filter works at the intermediate frequency, after the unwanted mixing has often already happened. Memory Trick: “Prevent IMD at the front door with front-end filtering.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-001-011
,
question,What devices would you install to reduce or eliminate interference to a home entertainment system from an HF transmitter?
optionA,Coils on ferrite cores
optionB,Bypass resistors
optionC,Metal oxide varistors
optionD,Bypass inductors
correctOption,A
explanation,"Coils on ferrite cores is correct because ferrite chokes on power, speaker, and interconnect leads act as RF filters, blocking HF currents from entering audio/video equipment. Bypass resistors or inductors are not standard RFI cures in this context, and MOVs protect against surges, not RF ingress. Memory Trick: “Clamp-on ferrite = clamp down the RF.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-001
,
question,What should be done if a properly operating amateur radio station is the cause of interference to a nearby telephone?
optionA,Make internal adjustments to the telephone equipment
optionB,Install a modular plug-in telephone RFI filter close to the telephone device
optionC,Ground and shield the telephone distribution amplifier
optionD,Stop transmitting whenever the telephone is in use
correctOption,B
explanation,"Install a modular plug-in telephone RFI filter close to the telephone device is correct because these filters are designed to keep RF out of the phone circuitry, solving the problem at the victim device. Grounding/shielding distribution amps is more complex and may not apply, you’re not required to stop transmitting if you are operating properly, and you should not alter someone else’s telephone internals. Memory Trick: “For phone RFI, plug in a phone RFI filter.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-002
,
question,What sound is heard from a public address system if audio rectification of a nearby single-sideband transmission occurs?
optionA,On-and-off humming or clicking
optionB,A steady hum
optionC,Distorted speech from the transmitter's signals
optionD,Clearly audible speech from the transmitter's signals
correctOption,C
explanation,"Distorted speech from the transmitter's signals is correct because the PA’s non-linear components are acting like a crude detector, turning RF into audio but with poor fidelity, so SSB speech sounds garbled or harsh. Clear speech would require a proper receiver, and hums or clicks are more typical of CW or power issues. Memory Trick: “SSB into audio gear = scrambled ghost voice in the speakers.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-003
,
question,What sound is heard from a public address system if audio rectification of a nearby CW transmission occurs?
optionA,"Audible, possibly distorted speech"
optionB,"Muffled, severely distorted speech"
optionC,A steady whistling
optionD,On-and-off humming or clicking
correctOption,D
explanation,"On-and-off humming or clicking is correct because CW is keyed on and off, so rectified RF becomes bursts of tone or clicks that follow the keying pattern. There is no speech content to be heard. Memory Trick: “CW in audio gear = clicks or buzz in code rhythm.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-004
,
question,"If an amateur radio transmission is heard in a device that contains no RF components, what type of interference is this?"
optionA,Audio rectification
optionB,Front-end overload
optionC,Splatter
optionD,Intermodulation
correctOption,A
explanation,"Audio rectification is correct because strong RF is being picked up by wiring and non-linear junctions inside the device (like diodes or transistor inputs), which then act like a detector and produce audio. There is no RF front end to “overload,” and splatter/intermodulation are RF-stage phenomena. Memory Trick: “No tuner, no RF stages, but you hear radio = audio circuits are rectifying RF.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-005
,
question,An amateur radio transmitter is being heard across the entire dial of a broadcast receiver. The receiver is most probably suffering from:
optionA,splatter from the transmitter
optionB,audio rectification
optionC,harmonics interference
optionD,poor image rejection
correctOption,B
explanation,"audio rectification is correct because if you hear the amateur signal everywhere on the dial, the RF is getting into the audio or detector stages directly, bypassing the tuned RF stages. Harmonics or images would appear on specific frequencies, not the whole dial, and splatter still stays near the transmit frequency. Memory Trick: “All over the dial usually means the dial is being bypassed (rectification).”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-006
,
question,Your SSB HF transmissions are heard muffled on a sound system in the living room regardless of its volume setting. What causes this?
optionA,Improper filtering in the transmitter
optionB,Lack of receiver selectivity
optionC,Audio rectification of strong signals
optionD,Harmonics generated at the transmitter
correctOption,C
explanation,"Audio rectification of strong signals is correct because the sound system is not a receiver, but strong RF is being detected in its input or amplifier stages. The fact that the effect is independent of the volume control is a key clue: the RF is entering after the volume control. Harmonics or filtering issues would mainly matter to radios, not to a hi-fi amp. Memory Trick: “If the volume knob doesn’t affect the ‘radio’ sound, it’s rectification past the knob.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-007
,
question,"What device can be used to minimize the effect of RF pickup by audio wires connected to stereo speakers, intercom amplifiers, telephones, etc.?"
optionA,High-pass filter
optionB,Attenuator
optionC,Surge suppressor
optionD,Coil on ferrite core
correctOption,D
explanation,"Coil on ferrite core is correct because ferrite chokes on audio leads present a high impedance to RF while passing audio, greatly reducing RF pickup. High-pass filters, attenuators, and surge suppressors are not the standard cure for RF on low-frequency audio wiring. Memory Trick: “Ferrite beads and chokes are the ‘aspirin’ for RF on cables.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-008
,
question,Stereo speaker leads often act as antennas to pick up RF signals. What is one method you can use to minimize this effect?
optionA,Shorten the leads
optionB,Lengthen the leads
optionC,Connect the speakers through audio attenuators
optionD,Connect the speakers through series capacitors
correctOption,A
explanation,"Shorten the leads is correct because long parallel wires make better antennas. Shorter leads intercept less RF and present a less efficient pickup path. Lengthening them makes the problem worse, and audio attenuators or series capacitors do not specifically address RF pickup on the leads themselves. Memory Trick: “Less wire, less antenna.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-009
,
question,One method of preventing RF from entering a stereo set through the speaker leads is to wrap each of the speaker leads:
optionA,around a wooden dowel
optionB,around a ferrite core
optionC,around a copper bar
optionD,around an iron bar
correctOption,B
explanation,"around a ferrite core is correct because ferrite increases the inductance for RF currents, choking them off while leaving audio essentially unchanged. Copper, iron bars, or wood do not provide the needed RF impedance in this way. Memory Trick: “If it’s ferrite, it fights RF.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-010
,
question,"You are using an HF off-centre-fed (OCF) unbalanced antenna. When you transmit on SSB, distorted audio and noise are heard from an outboard amplified speaker. What device could you install in the transmission line to mitigate this problem?"
optionA,A surge suppressor
optionB,An antenna tuner
optionC,A common-mode choke
optionD,A low-pass filter
correctOption,C
explanation,"A common-mode choke is correct because OCF and other unbalanced antennas often put RF current on the outside of the coax shield, which then flows into shack equipment and audio gear. A common-mode choke on the feed line blocks these currents. A low-pass filter only cleans up your transmitted RF spectrum; surge suppressors and tuners don’t directly stop common-mode RF from entering audio devices. Memory Trick: “Common-mode RF? Kill it with a choke on the feedline.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-002-011
,
question,What term describes the undesired creation of new frequency components when one or more signals enter a non-linear device?
optionA,Phase distortion
optionB,Linear distortion
optionC,Aliasing
optionD,Intermodulation
correctOption,D
explanation,"Intermodulation is correct because non-linear devices mix input frequencies, producing sums, differences, and other combinations that weren’t present before. Phase or linear distortion alter the original signals without creating new frequencies, and aliasing is a sampling/ADC issue, not an RF nonlinearity effect. Memory Trick: “Non-linear in, more lines out (extra frequencies) = intermodulation.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-001
,
question,"If someone tells you that signals from your hand-held transceiver are interfering with other signals on a frequency near yours, what could be the cause?"
optionA,Your hand-held is transmitting spurious emissions
optionB,You need to reduce your output power
optionC,Your hand-held has a chirp due to low battery voltage
optionD,Your hand-held offset is wrong
correctOption,A
explanation,"Your hand-held is transmitting spurious emissions is correct because interference on nearby frequencies usually means the transmitter is radiating energy outside its assigned channel, such as harmonics or other unwanted products. Low power, chirp, or wrong offset mainly affect your own signal quality, not nearby channels. Memory Trick: If others just off your frequency complain, think “spurs splashing next door.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-002
,
question,"If your transmitter sends signals outside the band where it is transmitting, what is this called?"
optionA,Off-frequency emissions
optionB,Spurious emissions
optionC,Side tones
optionD,Transmitter chirping
correctOption,B
explanation,"Spurious emissions is correct because it is the general term for unwanted signals emitted outside the necessary bandwidth or outside the assigned band, such as harmonics or mixing products. Side tones are audio monitor tones, and chirp is a frequency wobble during keying. Memory Trick: “Spurious” = “spare, unwanted” signals."
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-003
,
question,What problem may occur if your transmitter is operated without its cover or other shielding in place?
optionA,It may draw excessive current
optionB,It may transmit a chirpy signal
optionC,It may radiate spurious emissions
optionD,It may transmit a weak signal
correctOption,C
explanation,"It may radiate spurious emissions is correct because removing covers and shielding lets RF leak directly from internal circuits, bypassing normal filtering and causing strong off-frequency radiation. Power level, current draw, or chirp are not the primary issues here. Memory Trick: “No shield, RF is revealed (and leaks everywhere).”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-004
,
question,"In Morse code transmission, local RF interference (key clicks) is produced by:"
optionA,frequency shifting caused by poor voltage regulation
optionB,high frequency parasitic oscillations
optionC,poor wave-shaping caused by a defective filter capacitor
optionD,the making and breaking of the circuit at the Morse key
correctOption,D
explanation,"the making and breaking of the circuit at the Morse key is correct because hard on/off switching of RF produces very fast edges that contain wideband energy, heard as clicks on nearby receivers. The other options describe different faults but not the basic source of key clicks. Memory Trick: “Every hard on/off ‘click’ at the key becomes a click in someone’s speaker.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-005
,
question,"Key clicks, heard from a Morse code transmitter at a distant receiver, are the result of:"
optionA,too sharp rise and decay times of the keyed carrier
optionB,power supply hum modulating the carrier
optionC,sparks emitting RF from the key contacts
optionD,changes in oscillator frequency on keying
correctOption,A
explanation,"too sharp rise and decay times of the keyed carrier is correct because very abrupt keying generates a wide RF spectrum, which is heard as broad, clicky interference around the signal. Hum and frequency shift cause different kinds of distortion. Memory Trick: “Soften the edges, soften the clicks.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-006
,
question,"In a Morse code transmission, broad bandwidth RF interference (key clicks) heard at a distance is produced by:"
optionA,mechanical instability in the oscillator
optionB,poor shaping of the waveform
optionC,frequency shifting during keying
optionD,sparking at the key contacts
correctOption,B
explanation,"poor shaping of the waveform is correct because if the RF envelope rises and falls too abruptly, it creates many side frequencies, producing wide key clicks. The other issues may cause chirp or noise but not the classic wide click pattern. Memory Trick: “Good shaping, narrow signal; bad shaping, clicky signal.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-007
,
question,What should you do if you learn your transmitter is producing key clicks?
optionA,Regulate the oscillator supply voltage
optionB,Use a choke in the RF power output
optionC,Check the keying filter and the functioning of later stages
optionD,Adjust your key
correctOption,C
explanation,"Check the keying filter and the functioning of later stages is correct because key clicks are usually cured by improving the RF envelope shaping in the keying and amplifier stages (for example with proper shaping or ALC). Adjusting only the key or power supply does not directly fix the RF envelope. Memory Trick: “Key clicks are born in the shaping circuits, so fix the shaping path.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-008
,
question,What term describes an unwanted oscillation in an amplifier or oscillator circuit?
optionA,Secondary emission
optionB,Frequency instability
optionC,Harmonic emission
optionD,Parasitic oscillation
correctOption,D
explanation,"Parasitic oscillation is correct because it refers to an unintended self-oscillation at some frequency, often different from the desired one, inside an RF stage. Secondary emission is a tube effect, instability is general drift, and harmonics are multiples of a normal signal, not random extra oscillations. Memory Trick: “Parasitic = a ‘hitchhiker’ oscillation you did not invite.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-009
,
question,What can cause parasitic oscillations in a stage?
optionA,Unwanted positive feedback
optionB,Unwanted negative feedback
optionC,Oscillator drift
optionD,Power supply instability
correctOption,A
explanation,"Unwanted positive feedback is correct because positive feedback reinforces any small signal and can cause an amplifier to break into self-oscillation. Negative feedback tends to stabilize, not oscillate. Drift and supply issues may move frequency but are not the root of a parasitic oscillation. Memory Trick: “Positive feedback pushes gain over the edge into oscillation.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-010
,
question,Transmitter RF amplifiers can generate parasitic oscillations:
optionA,on harmonics of the transmitter frequency
optionB,above or below the transmitter frequency
optionC,on VHF frequencies only
optionD,on the transmitter fundamental frequency
correctOption,B
explanation,"above or below the transmitter frequency is correct because parasitic oscillations can occur at various unintended frequencies, not just exact harmonics or only on VHF. They may show up at lower or higher frequencies depending on stray capacitances and inductances. Memory Trick: “Parasites pick their own frequency, not just neat harmonics.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-003-011
,
question,"If a neighbour reports television interference on one or two channels only when you transmit on 15 metres, what is probably the cause of the interference?"
optionA,Television receiver front-end overload
optionB,Parasitic oscillations from your transmitter
optionC,Harmonic emissions from your transmitter
optionD,Splatter due to overmodulation
correctOption,C
explanation,"Harmonic emissions from your transmitter is correct because a harmonic of your 21 MHz signal can fall in or near a VHF TV channel, affecting just one or a few channels. Overload typically affects many channels at once, and parasitic oscillations are less predictable in frequency. Memory Trick: “Single TV band hit by HF station? Suspect harmonics lining up.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-004-001
,
question,What are harmonic emissions?
optionA,Unwanted signals that are combined with a 60 Hz hum
optionB,Unwanted signals caused by mixing with a nearby transmitter
optionC,Signals which cause skip propagation to occur
optionD,Unwanted signals at frequencies which are multiples of the fundamental (operating) frequency
correctOption,D
explanation,"Unwanted signals at frequencies which are multiples of the fundamental (operating) frequency is correct because harmonics occur at 2x, 3x, 4x, etc., the carrier frequency when stages are non-linear or filtering is poor. Hum and mixing are different phenomena. Memory Trick: “Harmonics march in multiples: 2f, 3f, 4f...”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-004-002
,
question,Why are harmonic emissions from an amateur radio station not wanted?
optionA,They may cause interference to other stations
optionB,They may result in excessive power dissipation
optionC,They may overload a nearby transmitter
optionD,They may interfere with stations on adjacent frequencies
correctOption,A
explanation,"They may cause interference to other stations is correct because harmonics often fall in other bands and services, such as TV, FM broadcast, or other amateur bands, causing harmful interference. Power dissipation and overload are not the main regulatory concern. Memory Trick: “Harmonics = you are accidentally on multiple bands at once, annoying others.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-004-003
,
question,What term describes unwanted radio energy transmitted just outside the necessary bandwidth?
optionA,Spurious emissions
optionB,Out-of-band emissions
optionC,Harmonic emissions
optionD,Parasitic emissions
correctOption,B
explanation,"Out-of-band emissions is correct because it refers to radiation on frequencies just outside the assigned band or channel, such as excessive sidebands or splatter. Harmonics are at multiples of the carrier, and “spurious” is a broader category that includes harmonics and out-of-band energy. Memory Trick: “Too close to the band edge but still outside = out-of-band.”"

question,If you are told your station was heard on 21.375 MHz but at the time you were operating on 7.125 MHz. What is one reason that could cause this to happen?
optionA,You were sending CW too fast
optionB,Your transmitter's power-supply filter capacitor is defective
optionC,Your transmitter radiates harmonic signals
optionD,Your transmitter's power-supply filter choke is defective
correctOption,C
explanation,"Your transmitter radiates harmonic signals is correct because 21.375 MHz is exactly 3 times 7.125 MHz, so this is the third harmonic of your operating frequency. That points directly to inadequate harmonic suppression. CW speed or power-supply ripple does not produce such an exact multiple. Memory Trick: “Heard on a multiple = it is a harmonic.”"

,
question,What causes splatter interference?
optionA,Keying a transmitter too fast
optionB,Unwanted feedback in an amplifier stage
optionC,The transmitting antenna is non-resonant
optionD,Overmodulating a transmitter
correctOption,D
explanation,"Overmodulating a transmitter is correct because when the audio level is too high, the signal goes non-linear and its sidebands spread out, causing interference to adjacent frequencies known as splatter. Fast keying or non-resonant antennas do not create the same wide SSB/AM sideband mess. Memory Trick: “Too much mic gain = ugly wide ‘splatter rain’ around your channel.”"

,
question,A television tuned to channel 3 (60 MHz - 66 MHz) experiences interference when you are transmitting on the 15-metre band. Other channels are not affected. What is the most likely cause?
optionA,Harmonic emission from your transmitter
optionB,No high-pass filter on the TV
optionC,No high-pass filter at your transmitter
optionD,Front-end overload of the TV
correctOption,A
explanation,"Harmonic emission from your transmitter is correct because a particular harmonic of your HF signal can land in the channel 3 band so that only that channel is disturbed. Overload or lack of filters typically affects several channels or creates more general problems. Memory Trick: “One TV channel, one matching harmonic.”"

,
question,"What is the probable cause of ""flat topping"" (non-linear operation) of an amplifier in an SSB transmitter?"
optionA,Defective low-pass filter
optionB,Excessive microphone gain
optionC,Defective sideband filter
optionD,Insufficient power supply current capacity
correctOption,B
explanation,"Excessive microphone gain is correct because driving the SSB stages too hard pushes them into saturation, clipping the peaks of the RF envelope. On a scope this looks like a flat top and on the air it sounds distorted and wide. Filters and supply issues can cause other problems but are not the classic flat-topping cause. Memory Trick: “If the RF peaks are cut off flat, your mic gain is too fat.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-004-008
,
question,Which of the following may cause excessive harmonics in a transmitter?
optionA,Defective driver circuit
optionB,Internal antenna tuner malfunction
optionC,Overdriven stages
optionD,Use of a non-resonant antenna
correctOption,C
explanation,"Overdriven stages is correct because when amplifier stages are driven beyond their linear region, they produce strong harmonic and intermodulation products. Antenna or tuner issues mainly affect matching and SWR, not the creation of harmonics at the source. Memory Trick: “Push the amp too hard, and it spits out lots of extra frequencies.”"

,
question,An interfering signal from an HF transmitter is found to have a frequency of 56 MHz. What could be the source?
optionA,Crystal oscillator operating on its fundamental
optionB,Seventh harmonic of an 80-metre transmission
optionC,Third harmonic of a 15-metre transmission
optionD,Second harmonic of a 10-metre transmission
correctOption,D
explanation,"Second harmonic of a 10-metre transmission is correct because the 10-metre band is around 28 MHz, and 2 × 28 MHz = 56 MHz. The other options do not match 56 MHz as neatly as a simple second harmonic from 10 metres. Memory Trick: “56 is double 28, so think 10-metre second harmonic.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-004-010
,
question,Harmonics may be produced in the RF power amplifier of a transmitter if:
optionA,excessive drive signal is applied to it
optionB,the output tank circuit is tuned to the fundamental frequency
optionC,the oscillator frequency is unstable
optionD,modulation is applied to a high-level stage
correctOption,A
explanation,"excessive drive signal is applied to it is correct because overdriving the RF power amplifier pushes it out of its linear region and causes distortion, which generates harmonics and other spurious signals. Proper drive keeps the stage linear and the output spectrum clean. Memory Trick: Think “too much drive = distorted and full of harmonics.”"

,
question,What is the frequency response of an ideal notch filter?
optionA,Attenuate all frequencies except a range of frequencies
optionB,Attenuate one frequency and pass all others
optionC,Attenuate a range of frequencies and pass all others
optionD,Attenuate all frequencies except one single frequency
correctOption,B
explanation,"Attenuate one frequency and pass all others is correct because a notch (band-stop) filter is designed to place a very deep “notch” at one specific frequency while leaving the rest of the spectrum largely unaffected. The other answers describe band-pass or wide band-reject responses, not a sharp notch. Memory Trick: Picture a graph with one deep narrow “bite” taken out at the problem frequency."

,
question,A filter attenuates frequencies below its cut-off frequency of 60 MHz. What type of filter is it?
optionA,Band-pass
optionB,Notch
optionC,High-pass
optionD,Low-pass
correctOption,C
explanation,"High-pass is correct because a high-pass filter rejects (attenuates) low frequencies and allows frequencies above the cut-off (here 60 MHz) to pass. Low-pass is the opposite, and band-pass or notch would only pass or reject a limited slice. Memory Trick: “High-pass lets the highs pass, blocks the lows.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-002
,
question,What type of filter attenuates RF energy above and below a certain range of frequencies?
optionA,High-pass
optionB,Notch
optionC,Low-pass
optionD,Band-pass
correctOption,D
explanation,"Band-pass is correct because a band-pass filter allows only a chosen band of frequencies through and attenuates signals both below and above that band. High-pass and low-pass each work on one side only, and a notch filter removes a narrow slice instead of passing it. Memory Trick: “Band-pass = only one slice of the spectrum gets through.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-003
,
question,Why should the impedance of a filter match the transmission line where it is inserted?
optionA,To avoid unwanted reflection
optionB,To preserve the balance of the line
optionC,To minimize noise in the receiver
optionD,To prevent spurious emissions
correctOption,A
explanation,"To avoid unwanted reflection is correct because when the filter’s impedance matches the transmission line (for example 50 ohms), power flows smoothly with minimal standing waves. A mismatch causes reflections, higher SWR, and extra loss. Memory Trick: “50 ohms into 50 ohms = no echoes, no surprises.”"

,
question,"Listening to shortwave on a low-cost software defined receiver (SDR), you hear several stations known to operate on much higher frequencies. What type of filter could help?"
optionA,Band-reject
optionB,Low-pass
optionC,High-pass
optionD,Band-pass
correctOption,B
explanation,"Low-pass is correct because placing a low-pass filter ahead of the SDR will pass only the desired HF shortwave range and strongly attenuate higher-frequency VHF/UHF signals that are folding back (aliasing) into the HF spectrum. High-pass or band-reject filters would not cleanly remove all the higher-frequency stations. Memory Trick: “To keep only HF, ‘low-pass’ lets the low stuff pass.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-005
,
question,You need to install an AC line filter to reduce radio frequency noise heard in your station equipment. What type of frequency response should it have?
optionA,Band-pass
optionB,Band-reject
optionC,Low-pass
optionD,High-pass
correctOption,C
explanation,"Low-pass is correct because the AC mains is at low frequency (50 or 60 Hz), so you want to pass that while blocking high-frequency RF noise riding on the power line. A low-pass filter does exactly that. High-pass or band-pass responses would block or distort the mains power itself. Memory Trick: “AC is low frequency, so use low-pass on the power line.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-006
,
question,A strong interfering signal is very close to your receive frequency. Which type of filter can effectively suppress it?
optionA,High-pass
optionB,Low-pass
optionC,Band-reject
optionD,Notch
correctOption,D
explanation,"Notch is correct because a notch filter can place a very narrow, deep rejection at the exact frequency of the interfering signal while leaving nearby desired frequencies mostly unaffected. Broad low-, high-, or band-reject filters would remove too much of the wanted band. Memory Trick: “Carve a tiny notch exactly where the pest lives.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-007
,
question,"In a Field Day operation with separate transmitters assigned to specific bands, what type of filter is needed on the receivers to minimize interference?"
optionA,Band-pass
optionB,Low-pass
optionC,High-pass
optionD,Band-reject
correctOption,A
explanation,"Band-pass is correct because each receiver can use a band-pass filter for its assigned band, greatly attenuating strong signals from other Field Day transmitters on different bands. Low-pass or high-pass filtering is too broad, and band-reject removes only a single unwanted range instead of isolating one operating band. Memory Trick: “One band per station? Give each receiver a band-pass window on just that band.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-008
,
question,A nearby high-power HF broadcast station in the 31-metre band is interfering with your reception on the 40-metre and 30-metre bands. What type of filter is needed on the receiver to minimize interference?
optionA,High-pass
optionB,Band-reject
optionC,Band-pass
optionD,Low-pass
correctOption,B
explanation,"Band-reject is correct because you want to notch out (reject) just the strong 31-metre broadcast band while still receiving both lower-frequency 40 metres and higher-frequency 30 metres. A band-pass filter would only let one band through, and low- or high-pass would remove either the desired lower or higher band. Memory Trick: “One noisy band in the middle? Use band-reject to ‘erase’ that band.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-009
,
question,Your 2-metre station suffers receiver overload from several land mobile service transmitters on adjacent bands. What type of filter could help?
optionA,High-pass
optionB,Notch
optionC,Band-pass
optionD,Low-pass
correctOption,C
explanation,"Band-pass is correct because a 2-metre band-pass filter will strongly pass only the 144–148 MHz region (in most countries) and attenuate strong out-of-band land mobile signals above and below that range, reducing overload. A single notch would remove only one interfering signal, and low- or high-pass filters are not selective enough. Memory Trick: “To protect 2 metres from neighbours, frame it with a band-pass window.”"
BankQuestionID,B-008-005-010
,
question,A filter attenuates frequencies above its cut-off frequency of 40 MHz. What type of filter is it?
optionA,Band-pass
optionB,High-pass
optionC,Notch
optionD,Low-pass
correctOption,D
explanation,"Low-pass is correct because a low-pass filter passes signals below its cut-off (40 MHz here) and attenuates higher-frequency signals. High-pass is the opposite, band-pass passes only a slice, and a notch removes just a narrow range. Memory Trick: “Below the cutoff passes, above it does not → low-pass.”"
